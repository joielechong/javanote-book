<exercise-question><p>Rewrite the <classname>PhoneDirectory</classname> class
from <localref href="arrays.4.2"/> so that it uses a <classname>TreeMap</classname>
to store directory entries, instead of an array.  (Doing this was suggested
in <localref href="generics.3.1"/>.)</p>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>The class that you are asked to write for this exercise
really is very trivial.  Everything that the class needs to do is already done
by the <classname>TreeMap</classname> class, and <classname>TreeMap</classname>
does much more besides.  In fact the only reason to write the <classname>PhoneDirectory</classname>
class is to <b>hide</b> a lot of the capabilities of <classname>TreeMaps</classname>.
A <classname>PhoneDirectory</classname> object is a "thin wrapper" around a <classname>TreeMap</classname>
object.  It allows only the operations <code>getNumber(name)</code> and
<code>putNumber(name,number)</code>.  Each of these can be implemented in a single line,
as a call to one of the methods in the <classname>TreeMap</classname>.  The
<classname>PhoneDirectory</classname> does provide nice, meaningful names
for the methods, and it adds a check to the implementation of <code>putNumber(name,number)</code>
to ensure that <code>name</code> and <code>number</code> are not <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>It would be nice for phone directories to have a few more capabilities.  A method for
listing the contents of the directory would be especially nice, so I have added one
to my class even though there was no such method in the original <classname>PhoneDirectory</classname>
class.  The print method uses a for-each loop to iterate through the entry set of
the phone directory. It is very similar to examples in <localref href="generics.3.2"/>
Even with this addition, though, the <classname>PhoneDirectory</classname> class is
still very far from being useful in real applications.</p>

<exercise id="generics.ex.2">
<exercise-question><p>In mathematics, several
operations are defined on sets. The <newword>union</newword> of two
sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in A together
with all the elements that are in B. The <newword>intersection</newword> 
of A and B is the set that contains elements that
are in both A and B. The <newword>difference</newword> of A and B is
the set that contains all the elements of A <b>except</b> for those elements
that are also in&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>Suppose that <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are variables of type <code>set</code> in
Java. The mathematical operations on <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> can be computed
using methods from the <classname>Set</classname> interface. In particular: 
<code>A.addAll(B)</code> computes the <i>union</i> of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>;
<code>A.retainAll(B)</code> computes the <i>intersection</i> of <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code>; and <code>A.removeAll(B)</code> computes the <i>difference</i> of <code>A</code>
and <code>B</code>. (These operations change the contents of the set <code>A</code>,
while the mathematical operations create a new set without changing <code>A</code>,
but that difference is not relevant to this exercise.)</p>

<p>For this exercise, you should write a program that can be used as a "set
calculator" for simple operations on sets of non-negative integers. (Negative
integers are not allowed.) A set of such integers will be represented as a list
of integers, separated by commas and, optionally, spaces and enclosed in square
brackets. For example: <code>[1,2,3]</code> or
<code>[17,&nbsp;42,&nbsp;9,&nbsp;53,&nbsp;108]</code>. The characters <code>+</code>,
<code>*</code>, and <code>-</code> will be used for the union, intersection, and
difference operations. The user of the program will type in lines of input
containing two sets, separated by an operator. The program should perform the
operation and print the resulting set. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>          Input                                 Output
         -------------------------           -------------------
          [1, 2, 3] + [3,  5,  7]             [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
          [10,9,8,7] * [2,4,6,8]              [8]
          [ 5, 10, 15, 20 ] - [ 0, 10, 20 ]   [5, 15]</pre>

<p>To represent sets of non-negative integers, use 
sets of type <classname>TreeSet&lt;Integer&gt;</classname>. Read the user's input,
create two <classname>TreeSets</classname>, and use the appropriate <classname>TreeSet</classname> method
to perform the requested operation on the two sets. Your program should be able
to read and process any number of lines of input. If a line contains a syntax
error, your program should not crash. It should report the error and move on to
the next line of input. (Note: To print out a <classname>Set</classname>, <code>A</code>, of
<classname>Integers</classname>, you can just say <code>System.out.println(A)</code>. I've chosen
the syntax for sets to be the same as that used by the system for outputting a
set.)</p>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>This program would be <b>much</b> easier to write if we could assume that
the user's input was in the correct format. Unfortunately, the exercise says
that we have to detect errors in the user's input and handle them by printing
error messages. To do this we have to constantly look ahead while reading the
user's input, to see whether the input agrees with what we are expecting. The
techniques for doing this were covered for the example 
<sourceref chapter="8" href="LengthConverter2.java"/> from <localref href="robustness.2.2"/>.
We can use the function <code>TextIO.peek()</code>
to look ahead at the next character in the user's input. We need to be able
to skip past any blanks in the input.  Instead of writing my own method to do
that, I use the method <code>TextIO.skipBlanks()</code> in my program.</p>


<p>My program uses exceptions to handle
the errors. Exceptions make it possible to organize the error-handling code in
a straightforward way. When an error is discovered, an exception is thrown. The
main program uses a <code>try..catch</code> statement to try to process one line
of input. If an error occurs, the program does not crash. The error is caught,
an error message is printed, and the program continues. I throw an error of
type <classname>IllegalArgumentException</classname> when an error is found. This exception
is a standard part of Java, but it might be better style to define a new error
class to represent the specific type of error that occurs in this program.</p>

<p>My program uses a method named <code>calc()</code> to read and process one line
of input. This method in turn uses another method, <code>readSet()</code> to read
each of the two sets of integers from the input line. Without error handling,
an algorithm for <code>readSet()</code> would be:</p>

<pre>Start with an empty set.
Read the '[' that begins the set.
Repeat:
   Read the next number and add it to the set.
   If the next character is ']':
      break.
   Read the comma that separates one number from the next.
Read the ']'.
Return the set.</pre>

<np>To turn this into a robust routine, we just have to check, before reading
anything, that the next character is legal. If not, throw an exception. This
adds a lot of code, but the nice thing about throwing exceptions is that it
doesn't disturb the logical flow of the routine.</np>

<p>There is one possible bug in the algorithm. It assumes that there is at
least one number in the set. But in mathematics, a set can be empty. I decided
to allow for the possibility of empty sets in my program. See the solution,
below.</p>

<p>An algorithm for the <code>calc()</code> method is even more straightforward.
Again, the basic algorithm ignores the possibility of errors:</p>

<pre>Read the first set, A.
Read the operator.
Read the second set, B.
if the operator is '+'
   A.addAll(B)  // Sets A equal to the union of A and B.
else if the operator is '*'
   A.retainAll(B)  // Sets A to the intersection.
else
   A.removeAll(B)  // Sets A to the difference.
Print A.</pre>

<np>In the program, an error check has to be added to make sure that there is a legal operator
in the correct position. I also add an error check to make sure that there is
no extra data on the line.</np>

<exercise>
<exercise-question><p>The fact that Java has a
<classname>HashMap</classname> class means that no Java programmer has to write an
implementation of hash tables from scratch&mdash;unless, of course, that programmer is a
computer science student.</p>
<p>For this exercise, you should write a hash table in which both the keys and the values are of
type <classname>String</classname>.  (This is not an exercise in generic programming;
do not try to write a generic class.)
Write an implementation of hash tables from scratch. Define the following
methods: <code>get(key)</code>, <code>put(key,value)</code>, <code>remove(key)</code>,
<code>containsKey(key)</code>, and <code>size()</code>. 
Remember that every object, <code>obj</code>, has a method <code>obj.hashCode()</code>
that can be used for computing a hash code for the object,
so at least you don't have to define your own hash function. 
Do not use <b>any</b> of Java's built-in generic types; create your own linked
lists using nodes as covered in <localref href="recursion.2.2"/>.  However,
you do <b>not</b> have to worry about increasing the size of the table when
it becomes too full.</p>
<p>You should also write a short program to test your solution.</p>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>Hash tables are discussed in <localref href="generics.3.3"/>.
A hash table is just an array of linked lists. Each linked list holds all
the items in the table that share the same hash code. Initially, all the lists
are empty (represented as <code>null</code> in the array). We need to be able to
add and delete items in the list. Methods for inserting and deleting
items can be found in <localref href="recursion.2.2"/>.
In a hash table, the order of items in a particular
list doesn't matter, so I simply insert each new item at the beginning of the
list. This makes the insert operation fairly simple. Deletion, however, is more
complicated, since we need to be able to delete an item no matter where it
occurs in a list.</p>

<p>A hash table really contains pairs of items, where each pair consists of a
key and an associated value.  To implement this, I use linked lists in which
each node contains both a key 
and a value, as well as the pointer to the next node in the list. The
end of a list is marked, as usual, by a <code>null</code> pointer. The nodes are
defined by a static nested class:</p>

<pre>private static class ListNode {
   String key;
   String value;
   ListNode next;
}</pre>

<np>The array of linked lists that stores all the data is of type
<atype>ListNode[]</atype>. Each item in the array is either <code>null</code> to indicate
an empty list, or it is a pointer to the first node in a linked list.</np>

<p>Given any key, we can find the linked list that should contain that key by
looking at the hash code of the key. The code computed by calling
<code>key.hashCode()</code> is of type <ptype>int</ptype>. We need a value that is in the
range of legal indices for the array. As noted in <localref href="generics.3.3"/>,
the value can be computed as <code>Math.abs(key.hashCode())&nbsp;%&nbsp;table.length</code>, 
where <code>table</code> is the array.</p>

<p>The hash code is used in all the methods that deal with keys, to decide which
linked list to look at. Once a list has been selected, the operations on the
list are pretty straightforward (given all the information and code in <localref href="recursion.2.2"/>), 
so I will not discuss them further here. You can look at the solution, below.</p>

<p>Although it is not required by the exercise, I defined a <code>resize()</code>
method that is used to increase the size of the table when the table becomes
too full. I call this method in the <code>put()</code> method when the table
becomes more than 3/4 full.</p>

<p>A major part of developing a class for general use is testing. It's
important to design a testing procedure that will test all aspects of the
class. For this problem, I wrote a testing program that would allow me to test
each of the methods in the class. I also added a method <code>dump()</code> to the
class; this method displays the entire hash table. This method does not really belong
in the class, since users of a hash table shouldn't care how the data is
stored. But I needed it to make sure that my <code>resize()</code> method is
working properly and that I could delete items correctly from all positions in
the lists (beginning, middle, and end).</p>
   
<p>By the way, you might be tempted to try to write a generic version of
<classname>HashTable</classname> in which the types of the keys and values are
given as type parameters in the definition of the class.  Unfortunately, you
would run into problems as soon as you tried to use an array in your class.
Generic classes don't work well with arrays, because arrays of generic type
can't be created at run time, as noted in <localref href="generics.1.3"/>.</p>

<exercise>
<exercise-question><p>A <newword>predicate</newword> is a boolean-valued function with one parameter.
Some languages use predicates in generic programming. Java&nbsp;7 doesn't, but this
exercise looks at how predicates might work. </p>

<p>In Java, we could implement "predicate objects" by defining a generic interface:</p>

<pre>public interface Predicate&lt;T&gt; {
    public boolean test( T obj );
}</pre>

<p>The idea is that an object that implements this interface knows how to
"test" objects of type <classname>T</classname>
in some way.   Define a class that contains 
the following generic static methods for working with predicate objects.
The name of the class should be <classname>Predicates</classname>, in analogy
with the standard class <classname>Collections</classname> that provides various
<code>static</code> methods for working with collections.</p>

<pre>public static &lt;T&gt; void remove(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred)
   // Remove every object, obj, from coll for which
   // pred.test(obj) is true.
   
public static &lt;T&gt; void retain(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred)
   // Remove every object, obj, from coll for which
   // pred.test(obj) is false.  (That is, retain the
   // objects for which the predicate is true.)
   
public static &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; collect(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred)
   // Return a List that contains all the objects, obj,
   // from the collection, coll, such that pred.test(obj)
   // is true.
   
public static &lt;T&gt; int find(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred)
   // Return the index of the first item in list
   // for which the predicate is true, if any.
   // If there is no such item, return -1.</pre>
   
<np>(In C++, methods similar to these are included as a standard part of the
generic programming framework.  And Java&nbsp;8 has a similar predicate interface,
and the <classname>Collections</classname> class has a <code>removeIf()</code> method
that uses a predicate.)</np>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>The code for this exercise is pretty short, but it
involves some advanced ideas, including methods with bounded type parameters
(from <localref href="generics.5.4"/>).  Aside from that,
the main point of the exercise is to introduce predicates and show how they might
be useful in generic programming. The operation of finding all the items in a
collection that satisfy some condition is very common. The code to do it is not
hard to write, but even so, it is nice to have it done once and for all. In this
exercise, the condition that the items have to satisfy is represented as a
<classname>Predicate</classname>. The <code>collect()</code> method provides a general way to
find all the items that satisfy the condition. The items are dumped into a
collection, which can then be processed further if necessary. If I wanted to
carry this generic programming thing even further, I would define another
interface:</p>

<pre>public interface Processor&lt;T&gt; {
   public void process( T obj );
}</pre>

<np>and define a generic method for applying a <classname>Processor</classname> object to each
item in a collection. With <classname>Predicates</classname> and <classname>Processors</classname> in hand,
it would hardly ever be necessary to write a loop for iterating through all the
items in a collection.</np>

<break/>

<p>The implementation of the <code>collect()</code> method simply uses a
for-each loop to go through the collection, <code>coll</code>, and puts every
item that satisfies the predicate into a list. The method returns an object of
type <classname>List</classname>, but <classname>List</classname> is only an interface. Any real list must
belong to one of the classes that implement this interface, such as
<classname>LinkedList</classname> or <classname>ArrayList</classname>. I create the list as an
<classname>ArrayList</classname>, but a <classname>LinkedList</classname> would also be reasonable.
(Perhaps the return type of the method should have been specified as
<classname>ArrayList</classname> rather than <classname>List</classname> so that users of the method would
know exactly what they are getting.)</p>

<pre>/**
 * Return a List that contains all the objects, obj, from the collection, 
 * coll, for which pred.test(obj) is true.
 */
public static &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; collect(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred) {
   List&lt;T&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
   for ( T item : coll ) {
      if (pred.test(item))
         list.add(item);
   }
   return list;
} // end collect()</pre>

<p>The <code>remove()</code> and <code>retain()</code> methods are similar to
<code>collect()</code>, except that instead of making a new collection, they modify
the collection, <code>coll</code>.  A for-each loop cannot modify the collection
over which it is iterating, so the <code>remove()</code> and <code>retain()</code> methods
will have to use <classname>Iterators</classname>.  Recall that if <code>iter</code>
is an <classname>Iterator</classname> for a collection, then the method
<code>iter.remove()</code> will remove from the collection the item that was seen
most recently by the iterator.  The <code>remove()</code> method can be written
as:</p>
   
<pre>/**
 * Remove every object, obj, from coll for which pred.test(obj) is true.
 */
public static &lt;T&gt; void remove(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred) {
   Iterator&lt;T&gt; iter = coll.iterator();
   while (iter.hasNext()) {
      T item = iter.next();
      if (pred.test(item))
         iter.remove();
   }
} // end remove()</pre>
   
<np>The <code>retain()</code> method is almost identical to this, and the
<code>find()</code> method is easy to write using an ordinary <code>for</code>
loop.  See my solution, below.</np>

<p>My test program simply creates some collections and applies the methods from
the <classname>Predicates</classname> class to them. My collections contain objects of type
<classname>Integer</classname> and I made two <classname>Predicates</classname> that work on objects of
this type. To define such a predicate, we need a class that implements the interface
<classname>Predicate&lt;Integer&gt;</classname>, and then we have to make an object belonging to
that class. For example, I define the class:</p>

<pre>/**
 * An object of type Even tests an Object of type Integer to see whether the 
 * integer that it represents is an even number. Note that the test() method 
 * should only be applied to non-null values of type Integer.
 */
static class Even implements Predicate&lt;Integer&gt; {
   public boolean test(Integer i) {
      if ( i % 2 == 0 )
         return true;
      else
         return false;
   }
} // end class Even</pre>

<np>The predicate object is then created with a command:</np>

<pre>Predicate&lt;Integer&gt; pred = new Even():</pre>

<np>A predicate object belonging to class <classname>Even</classname> will throw an exception
if its <code>test()</code> method is applied to a <code>null</code> value. If this class were 
meant for more
general use, it might be better to define <code>test()</code> so that it simply
returns the answer "false" in this case:</np>

<pre>/**
 * An object of type Even tests an Object of type Integer to see whether the 
 * integer that it represents is an even number.  <newcode>When applied to a null</newcode>
 * <newcode>object, the test returns the value false.</newcode>
 */
static class Even implements Predicate&lt;Integer&gt; {
   public boolean test(Integer i) {
      <newcode>if (i == null)
         return false;</newcode>
      else if ( i % 2 == 0 )
         return true;
      else
         return false;
   }
} // end class Even</pre>

<break/>

<p>Note that a <classname>Predicate</classname> is an object, but we are really only
interested in the <code>test()</code> method of the object. In some languages,
including C++, it is possible to pass a function as a parameter to another
function. In those languages, predicates are simply functions that return
boolean values, and working with predicates does not require the overhead of
making classes and objects. Of course, things are not so bad in Java if you
make use of an anonymous nested class to define the predicate. In fact, you can
define the predicate right in the function call where you need it. For
example:</p>

<pre>result = Predicates.collect( coll, 
                    new Predicate&lt;Integer&gt;() {
                       public boolean test(Integer i) {
                          return (i != null &amp;&amp; i &gt; 100);
                       }
                    } );</pre>
                    
<p>Furthermore, in Java 8, the predicate can be defined as a lamda
expression (see <localref href="OOP.8.4"/>), which simplifies the code
quite a bit:</p>

<pre>result = Predicates.collect(coll, i -&gt; i != null &amp;&amp; i &gt; 0))</pre>

<exercise id="generics.ex.5">
<exercise-question><p>An example in
<localref href="generics.4.2"/> concerns the problem of making an index for
a book. A related problem is making a <newword>concordance</newword>
for a document. A concordance lists every word that occurs in the document, and
for each word it gives the line number of every line in the document where the
word occurs. All the subroutines for creating an index that were presented in
<localref href="generics.4.2"/> can also be used to create a concordance. The only real
difference is that the integers in a concordance are line numbers rather than
page numbers.</p>

<p>Write a program that can create a concordance. The document should be read
from an input file, and the concordance data should be written to an output
file. You can use the indexing
subroutines from <localref href="generics.4.2"/>, modified to write the data to <code>TextIO</code>
instead of to <code>System.out</code>. (You will need to make these subroutines
<code>static</code>.) The input and output files should be selected by the user when
the program is run.  The sample program <sourceref href="WordCount.java"/>,
from <localref href="generics.4.4"/>, can be used as a model of how to use files.
That program also has a useful subroutine that reads one word from input.</p>

<p>As you read the file, you want to take each word that you encounter and add
it to the concordance along with the current line number.  Keeping track of
the line numbers is one of the trickiest parts of the problem. In an input file,
the end of each line in the file is
marked by the newline character,&nbsp;'\n'. Every time you encounter this
character, you have to add one to the line number.  WordCount.java
ignores ends of lines.  Because you need to
find and count the end-of-line characters, your program cannot
process the input file in exactly the same way as does WordCount.java.
Also, you will need to detect the end of the file.  The function
<code>TextIO.peek()</code>, which is used to look ahead at the next character
in the input, returns the value <code>TextIO.EOF</code> at end-of-file,
after all the characters in the file have been read.</p>

<p>Because it is so common, don't include the word "the" in your concordance.
Also, do not include words that have length less than&nbsp;3.</p>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>Solving this exercise, for the most part, means collecting subroutines that
were presented in <localref href="generics.4.2"/> into a complete program. 
I copied the method <code>addReference()</code> directly, just making it <code>static</code>
and changing the names of the parameters to names that are more appropriate for
a concordance. I copied <code>printIntegers()</code>, changed its name
to <code>printConcordance</code>, made it static, and changed
"System.out.print" to "TextIO.put" so that it would send its output to the file
selected by the user.</p>
   
<p>In <localref href="generics.4.3"/>, I discussed the problem that arises when
comparing strings that differ only in their use of upper and lower case.  In that
subsection, I used a <classname>Comparator</classname> to solve the problem.
In my solution to this exercise, however, I used the simpler solution of
converting all words to lower case immediately after reading them from the
file.  For lower case words, the default ordering is alphabetical order,
so I don't need a <classname>Comparator</classname>.</p>

<p>It remains to write the <code>main()</code> routine, which is similar in outline
to the <code>main()</code> routine in <code>WordCount.java</code>. One difference is
that we have to keep track of line numbers. We can do this by looking for
new-line characters as we skip over the characters between words. 
While we do this, we have to be on the alert for the special character
<code>TextIO.EOF</code> that is returned by <code>TextIO.peek()</code>
when the end of the file is reached.  A pseudocode
algorithm can be given as:</p>

<pre>Open the input files.

Let lineNum = 1.

Repeat:
   
      // Skip over any non-letters in the input, stopping when a
      // letter (marking the beginning of a word) or EOF is found.
      
      while the next character is not end-of-file or a letter:
         Read the next character.
         If it is a new line character:
            Count the line by adding 1 to lineNum
      
      // After the while loop, we are looking at either the end of file
      //    or at a letter that is the beginning of the next word.
      
      If at end-of-file:
         Exit from the loop.
      
      Get the next word from the input file.
      Convert the word to lower case.
      if the word is not "the" and has length &gt; 2:
         Add the word and lineNum to the concordance.

Open the output file.

Print the concordance.</pre>


<p>This can be translated directly (using some code from <sourceref href="WordCount.java"/>)
to give the <code>main()</code> routine.   For reading individual words from
input, the method <code>readNextWord()</code> can be copied directly from
WordCount.java.  (In my program, I used a slightly simpler method named
<code>readWord()</code> which uses the fact that when <code>readWord()</code>
is called by the <code>main()</code> routine, the next character in input
is already known to be a letter.)</p>

<exercise>
<exercise-question><p>The sample program
<sourceref href="SimpleInterpreter.java"/> from <localref href="generics.4.1"/>
can carry out  commands of the form "let variable = expression" or "print expression".
That program can handle expressions that contain variables,
numbers, operators, and parentheses. Extend the program so that it can also
handle the standard mathematical functions <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>,
<code>tan</code>, <code>abs</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, and <code>log</code>. For example, the
program should be able to evaluate an expression such as
<code>sin(3*x-7)+log(sqrt(y))</code>, assuming that the variables <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> have been given values.  Note that the name of a function
must be followed by an expression that is enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<p>In the original program, a symbol table holds a value for each variable that
has been defined. In your program, you should add another type of symbol to the
table to represent standard functions.   You can use the following nested
enumerated type and class for this purpose:</p>

<pre>private enum Functions { SIN, COS, TAN, ABS, SQRT, LOG }

/**
 * An object of this class represents one of the standard functions.
 */
private static class StandardFunction {

   /**
    * Tells which function this is.
    */
   Functions functionCode; 

   /**
    * Constructor creates an object to represent one of 
    * the standard functions
    * @param code which function is represented.
    */
   StandardFunction(Functions code) {
      functionCode = code;
   }

   /**
    * Finds the value of this function for the specified 
    * parameter value, x.
    */
   double evaluate(double x) {
      switch(functionCode) {
      case SIN:
         return Math.sin(x);
      case COS:
         return Math.cos(x);
      case TAN:
         return Math.tan(x);
      case ABS:
         return Math.abs(x);
      case SQRT:
         return Math.sqrt(x);
      default:
         return Math.log(x);
      }
   }

} // end class StandardFunction</pre>
   
<p>Add a symbol to the symbol table to represent each function. The key is the
name of the function and the value is an object of type
<classname>StandardFunction</classname> that represents the function. For example:</p>

<pre>symbolTable.put("sin", new StandardFunction(Function.SIN));</pre>

<np>In SimpleInterpreter.java, the symbol table is a map of type
<classname>HashMap&lt;String,Double&gt;</classname>.  It's not legal to
use a <classname>StandardFunction</classname> as the value in such a map,
so you will have to change the type of the map.  The map has to hold two
different types of objects.  The easy way to make this possible is to create
a map of type <classname>HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt;</classname>.
(A better way is to create a general type to represent objects that
can be values in the symbol table, and to define two subclasses of that
class, one to represent variables and one to represent standard functions,
but for this exercise, you should do it the easy way.)</np>

<p>In your parser, when you encounter a word, you have to be able to tell
whether it's a variable or a standard function. Look up the word in the symbol
table. If the associated object is non-null and is of type <classname>Double</classname>, then
the word is a variable. If it is of type <classname>StandardFunction</classname>, then the
word is a function. Remember that you can test the type of an object using the
<code>instanceof</code> operator. For example: <code>if (obj instanceof
Double)</code></p>
</exercise-question>
<exercise-discuss><p>The changes that must be made to <sourceref href="SimpleInterpreter.java"/> 
are remarkably small,
aside from defining the <classname>StandardFunction</classname> class. In my solution, I
included this class as a static nested class in my main program class. It would
also make sense to define it as a separate class.</p>

<p>I changed the type of the map to <classname>HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt;</classname>,
as suggested in the exercise.
I added a few lines of code at the beginning of the <code>main()</code> routine to
add the six standard functions to the symbol table, using statements similar to
the example given in the exercise:</p>
   
<pre>symbolTable.put("sin", new StandardFunction(Functions.SIN));
symbolTable.put("cos", new StandardFunction(Functions.COS));
symbolTable.put("tan", new StandardFunction(Functions.TAN));
symbolTable.put("abs", new StandardFunction(Functions.ABS));
symbolTable.put("sqrt", new StandardFunction(Functions.SQRT));
symbolTable.put("log", new StandardFunction(Functions.LOG));</pre>
      
<p>The only other change is in the parsing routines. 
The change is in the <code>primaryValue()</code> method. When a word
is encountered, the computer must check whether the word is a variable or a
standard function. This is done, as suggested in the exercise, by looking up
the word in the symbol table and checking the type of the associated value. If
the word is a standard function, then we have to read and evaluate the argument
of the function and then find the value of the function at that argument value:</p>

<pre>else if ( Character.isLetter(ch) ) {
      // The factor is a variable <newcode>or a standard function</newcode>.  Read its name and
      // look up its value in the symbol table.  If the name is not in the symbol table,
      // an error occurs.  (Note that the values in the symbol table are objects of type 
      // Double <newcode>or StandardFunction</newcode>.)
   String name = readWord();
   <newcode>Object obj = symbolTable.get(name);</newcode>
   if (obj == null)
      throw new ParseError("Unknown word \"" + name + "\"");
   <newcode>assert (obj instanceof Double || obj instanceof StandardFunction);</newcode>
   <newcode>if (obj instanceof Double)</newcode> {
         // The name is a variable; return value of that variable.
      Double val = (Double)obj;
      return val.doubleValue();
   }
   <newcode>else {
         // The name is a standard function.  Read the argument
         // of the function and return the value of the function
         // at that argument.  The argument must be an expression
         // in parentheses.
      StandardFunction func = (StandardFunction)obj;
      TextIO.skipBlanks();
      if ( TextIO.peek() != '(' )
         throw new ParseError("Parenthesis missing after standard function");
      TextIO.getChar(); // discard the '('
      double argument = expressionValue();  // read and evaluate expression
      TextIO.skipBlanks();
      if ( TextIO.peek() != ')' )
         throw new ParseError("Missing right parenthesis.");
      TextIO.getChar(); // discard the ')'
      return func.evaluate(argument);
   }</newcode>
}</pre>

<p>There is one additional change that I might have made. As the program
stands, it allows the user to use a "let" command to assign a value to one of
the standard function names. For example: "let sin = 42". This effectively
changes the name so that it is a variable, and the standard function is no
longer available for use in expressions. It would probably be better to give an error
message when the user tries to assign a value to a standard function name. This
could be done in the <code>doLetCommand()</code> method.  After reading the
variable name in the "let" command, we have to check whether the name is already
in the symbol table as the name of a standard function:</p>

<pre>private static void doLetCommand() throws ParseError {
   TextIO.skipBlanks();
   if ( ! Character.isLetter(TextIO.peek()) )
      throw new ParseError("Expected variable name after 'let'.");
   String varName = readWord();  // The name of the variable.
   <newcode>Object symbol = symbolTable.get(name);            
   if (symbol != null &amp;&amp; symbol instanceof StandardFunction)
       throw new ParseError("Can't assign a value to a standard function name.");</newcode>
   TextIO.skipBlanks();
   if ( TextIO.peek() != '=' )
      throw new ParseError("Expected '=' operator for 'let' command.");
   TextIO.getChar();
   double val = expressionValue();  // The value of the variable.

<p><b>Changes from the program <sourceref href="SimpleInterpreter.java"/>
are shown in &newcodestyle;.</b></p>
   
<pre><prog name="SimpleInterpreter2">/*
    This program can evaluate expressions that can include
    numbers, variables, parentheses, and the operators +,
    -, *, /, and ^ (where ^ indicates raising to a power),
    <newcode>and standard functions sin, cos, tan, abs, sqrt, and log.</newcode>
    A variable name must consist of letters and digits,
    beginning with a letter.  Names are case-sensitive.
    This program accepts commands of two types from the user.
    For a command of the form  print &lt;expression&gt; , the expression
    is evaluated and the value is output.  For a command of
    the form  let &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;expression&gt; , the expression is
    evaluated and the value is assigned to the variable.
    If a variable is used in an expression before it has been
    assigned a value, an error occurs.  A number must begin with 
    a digit (i.e., not a decimal point).

    Commands are formally defined by the BNF rules:

            &lt;command&gt;  ::=  "print" &lt;expression&gt;
                               |  "let" &lt;variable&gt; "=" &lt;expression&gt;

            &lt;expression&gt;  ::=  [ "-" ] &lt;term&gt; [ [ "+" | "-" ] &lt;term&gt; ]...

            &lt;term&gt;  ::=  &lt;factor&gt; [ [ "*" | "/" ] &lt;factor&gt; ]...

            &lt;factor&gt;  ::=  &lt;primary&gt; [ "^" &lt;primary&gt; ]...

            &lt;primary&gt;  ::=  &lt;number&gt; | &lt;variable&gt; | "(" &lt;expression&gt; ")"
                                 <newcode>| &lt;standard-function-name&gt; "(" &lt;expression&gt; ")"</newcode>

    A line of input must contain exactly one such command.  If extra
    data is found on a line after an expression has been read, it is
    considered an error.  The variables "pi" and "e" are defined
    when the program starts to represent the usual mathematical
    constants.

    This program demonstrates the use of a HashMap as a symbol
    table.

    SimpleInterpreter2.java is based on the program SimpleInterpreter.java,
    which did not handle standard functions in expressions.
    
    This program depends on the non-standard class, TextIO.
