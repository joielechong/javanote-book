<section id="GUI2.4" title="Complex Components and MVC">
   
<p><start><big>S</big>ince even buttons</start> turn out to be pretty complex, as seen
in the <localref href="GUI2.3">previous section</localref>, you might guess that there
is a lot more complexity lurking in the Swing API.  While this is true, a lot of that
complexity works to your benefit as a programmer, since a lot of it is hidden in
normal uses of Swing components.  For example, you don't have to know about all the
complex details of buttons in order to use them effectively in most programs.</p>
   
<p>Swing defines several component classes that are much more complex than those
we have looked at so far, but even the most complex components are not very
difficult to use for many purposes.  In this section, we'll look at components
that support display and manipulation of lists, tables, and text documents.
To use these complex components effectively, you'll need to know something about
the Model-View-Controller pattern that is used as a basis for the design of
many Swing components.  This pattern is discussed in the first part of this section.</p>

<p>This section is our last look at Swing components, but there are a number of
component classes that have not even been touched on in this book.  Some useful
ones that you might want to look into include:  <classname>JTabbedPane</classname>,
<classname>JSplitPane</classname>, <classname>JTree</classname>, <classname>JSpinner</classname>,
<classname>JPopupMenu</classname>, <classname>JProgressBar</classname>, and
<classname>JScrollBar</classname>.</p>
   
<p>At the end of the section, we'll look briefly at the idea of writing custom
component classes&mdash;something that you might consider when
even the large variety of components that are already
defined in Swing don't do quite what you want (or when they do too much,
and you want something simpler).</p>

   
<subsection id="GUI2.4.1" title="Model-View-Controller">
   
<p>One of the principles of object-oriented design is division of responsibilities.
Ideally, an object should have a single, clearly defined role, with a limited
realm of responsibility.  One application of this principle to the design of
graphical user interfaces is the <newword>MVC pattern</newword>.  "MVC" stands
for "Model-View-Controller" and refers to three different realms of responsibility
in the design of a graphical user interface.</p>
   
<p>When the MVC pattern is applied to a component, the <newword>model</newword>
consists of the data that represents the current state of the component.
The <newword>view</newword> is simply the visual presentation of the
component on the screen.  And the <newword>controller</newword> is the
aspect of the component that carries out actions in response to events
generated by the user (or by other sources such as timers).  The idea is to assign responsibility for the
model, the view, and the controller to different objects.</p>
   
<p>The view is the easiest part of the MVC pattern to understand.  It is
often represented by the component object itself, and its responsibility
is to draw the component on the screen.  In doing this, of course, it
has to consult the model, since the model represents the state of the
component, and that state can determine what appears on the screen.
To get at the model data&mdash;which is stored in a separate object
according to the MVC pattern&mdash;the component object needs to keep
a reference to the model object. Furthermore, when the model changes,
the view often needs to be redrawn to reflect the changed state.
The component needs some way of knowing when changes in the model
occur.  Typically, in Java, this is done with events and listeners.  The
model object is set up to generate events when its data changes.
The view object registers itself as a listener for those events. When the model
changes, an event is generated, the view is notified of that event, and the
view responds by updating its appearance on the screen.</p>
   
<p>When MVC is
used for Swing components, the controller is generally not so well defined
as the model and view, and its responsibilities are often split
among several objects.  The controller might include mouse
and keyboard listeners that respond to user events on the view;
<classname>Actions</classname> that respond to menu commands or buttons;
and listeners for other high-level events, such as those from a slider,
that affect the state of the component.  Usually, the controller
responds to events by making modifications to the model, and
the view is changed only indirectly, in response to the changes
in the model.</p>
   
<p>The MVC pattern is used in many places in the design of Swing.
It is even used for buttons.  The state of a Swing button is
stored in an object of type <classname>ButtonModel</classname>.
The model stores such information as whether the button is enabled,
whether it is selected, and what <classname>ButtonGroup</classname>
it is part of, if any.  If <code>button</code> is of type
<classname>JButton</classname> (or one of the other subclasses
of <classname>AbstractButton</classname>), then its
<classname>ButtonModel</classname> can be obtained by calling
<code>button.getModel()</code>.  In the case of buttons, you 
might never need to use the model or even know that it exists.
But for the list and table components that we will look at
next, knowledge of the model is essential.</p>

   
   
</subsection>
   
   
<subsection id="GUI2.4.2" title="Lists and ListModels">
   
<p>A <classname>JList</classname> is a component that represents a list
of items that can be selected by the user.  The sample program
<sourceref href="SillyStamper.java"/> allows the user to select
one icon from a <classname>JList</classname> of <classname>Icons</classname>.
The user selects an icon from the list by clicking on it.
The selected icon can be "stamped" onto a drawing area by clicking on
the drawing area.  (The icons in this program are from the KDE desktop project.)
Here
is a picture of the program with several icons already stamped onto the
drawing area and with the "star" icon selected:</p>

<img src="silly-stamper.png" width="458" height="341" alt="screenshot from SillyStamper.java"
   tex="silly-stamper.eps" texscale="0.6"/>   
   
<np>Note that the scrollbar in this program is not part of the <classname>JList</classname>.
To add a scrollbar to a list, the list must be placed into a <classname>JScrollPane</classname>.
See <localref href="GUI1.6.4"/>, where the use of <classname>JScrollPane</classname> to
hold a <classname>JTextArea</classname> was discussed.  Scroll panes are used in the
same way with lists and with other components.  In this case, the <classname>JList</classname>,
<code>iconList</code>, was added to a scroll pane and the scroll pane was added to
a panel with the single command:</np>
   
<pre>add( new JScrollPane(iconList), BorderLayout.EAST );</pre>
   
<p><classname>JList</classname> is a parameterized
type, where the type parameter indicates what type of object can be displayed in the list.
The most common types are <atype>JList&lt;String&gt;</atype> and <atype>JList&lt;Icon&gt;</atype>.
Other types can be used, but they will be converted to strings for display.
(It's possible to "teach" a <classname>JList</classname> how to display other types of items;
see the <code>setCellRenderer()</code> method in the <classname>JList</classname>
class.)</p>

<p>One way to construct a <classname>JList</classname> is from an array that contains
the objects that will appear in the list.  In the <code>SillyStamper</code> program, the images for the icons are
read from resource files, the icons are placed into an array, and the array
is used to construct a <atype>JList&lt;Icon&gt;</atype>.  This is done by the following method:</p>

<pre>private JList&lt;Icon&gt; createIconList() {

   String[] iconNames = new String[] {
      "icon5.png", "icon7.png", "icon8.png", "icon9.png", "icon10.png", 
      "icon11.png", "icon24.png", "icon25.png", "icon26.png", "icon31.png", 
      "icon33.png", "icon34.png"
   };              // Array containing resource file names for the icon images.

   iconImages = new Image[iconNames.length];

   ClassLoader classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
   Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
   try {                        // Get the icon images from the resource files.
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; iconNames.length; i++) {
         URL imageURL = classLoader.getResource("stamper_icons/" + iconNames[i]);
         if (imageURL == null)
            throw new Exception();
         iconImages[i] = toolkit.createImage(imageURL);
      }
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
      iconImages = null;
      return null;
   }

   ImageIcon[] icons = new ImageIcon[iconImages.length];
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; iconImages.length; i++)  // Create the icons.
      icons[i] = new ImageIcon(iconImages[i]);
   
   JList&lt;Icon&gt; list = new JList&lt;Icon&gt;(icons);  // A list containing image icons.
   list.setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION);
   list.setSelectedIndex(0);   // First item in the list is currently selected.
   
   return list;
}</pre>   

<p>By default, the user can select any number of items in a list.  A single item is 
selected by clicking on it.  Multiple items can be selected by shift-clicking and
by either control-clicking or meta-clicking (depending on the platform).
In the <code>SillyStamper</code> program, I wanted to restrict the selection so that only
one item can be selected at a time.  This restriction is imposed by calling</p>
   
<pre>list.setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION);</pre>
   
<np>With this selection mode, when the user selects an item, the previously
selected item, if any, is deselected.  Note that the selection can be
changed by the program by calling <code>list.setSelectedIndex(itemNum)</code>.
Items are numbered starting from zero.  To find out the currently selected
item in single selection mode, call <code>list.getSelectedIndex()</code>.
This returns the item number of the selected item, or <code>-1</code> if
no item is currently selected.  If multiple selections are allowed,
you can call <code>list.getSelectedIndices()</code>, which returns
an array of <ptype>ints</ptype> that contains the item numbers of
all selected items.</np>
   
<p>Now, the list that you see on the screen is only the <i>view</i> aspect
of the list.  The <i>controller</i> consists of the listener objects that
respond when the user clicks an item in the list.  For its <i>model</i>,
a <classname>JList</classname> uses an object of type <classname>ListModel</classname>.
This is the object that knows the actual list of items.  A model is
defined not only by the data that it contains but by the set of operations
that can be performed on the data.  When a <classname>JList</classname> is
constructed from an array of objects, the model that is used is very simple.
The model can tell you how many items it contains and what those items are,
but it can't do much else.  In particular, there is no way to add items
to the list or to delete items from the list!  If you need that capability,
you will have to use a different list model.</p>

<p>The class <classname>DefaultListModel</classname> defines list models that
support adding items to and removing items from the list.  Like <classname>JList</classname>,
it is a parameterized class. (Note that the
list model that you get when you create a <classname>JList</classname> from
an array is <b>not</b> of this type.)  If <code>dlmodel</code> is of type
<classname>DefaultListModel</classname>, the following methods, among
others, are defined:</p>
   
<ul>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.getSize()</codedef> &mdash; returns the number of items.</li>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.getElementAt(index)</codedef> &mdash; returns the item at position
   <code>index</code> in the list.</li>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.addElement(item)</codedef> &mdash; Adds <code>item</code> to the
   end of the list; <code>item</code> can be any <classname>Object</classname>.</li>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.insertElementAt(item, index)</codedef> &mdash; inserts the specified
<code>item</code> into the list at the specified <code>index</code>; items that come
after that position in the list are moved down to make room for the new item.</li>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.setElementAt(item, index)</codedef> &mdash; Replaces the item
that is currently at position <code>index</code> in the list with <code>item</code>.</li>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.remove(index)</codedef> &mdash; removes the item at position <code>index</code>
  in the list.</li>
<li><codedef>dlmodel.removeAllElements()</codedef> &mdash; removes everything from the list,
  leaving it empty.</li>
</ul>
   
<p>To use a modifiable <atype>JList&lt;T&gt;</atype>, you should create a
<atype>DefaultListModel&lt;T&gt;</atype>, add any items to it that should be
in the list initially, and pass it to the <classname>JList</classname>
constructor.  For example:</p>
   
<pre>DefaultListModel&lt;String&gt; listModel;
JList&lt;String&gt; flavorList;
   
listModel = new DefaultListModel&lt;String&gt;();    // Create the model object.
   
listModel.addElement("Chocolate");     // Add items to the model.
listModel.addElement("Vanilla");
listModel.addElement("Strawberry");
listModel.addElement("Rum Raisin");
   
flavorList = new JList&lt;String&gt;(listModel);     // Create the list component.</pre>
   
<np>By keeping a reference to the model around in an instance variable, you
will be able to add and delete flavors as the program is running by calling
the appropriate methods in <code>listModel</code>.  Keep in mind that
changes that are made to the <i>model</i> will automatically be reflected
in the <i>view</i>.  Behind the scenes, when a list model is modified, it generates
an event of type <classname>ListDataEvent</classname>.  The <classname>JList</classname>
registers itself with its model as a listener for these events, and it
responds to an event by redrawing itself to reflect the changes in the
model.  The programmer doesn't have to take any extra action, beyond changing the model.</np>
   
<p>By the way, the model for a <classname>JList</classname> actually has another
part in addition to the <classname>ListModel</classname>:  
An object of type <classname>ListSelectionModel</classname>
stores information about which items in the list are currently selected.
When the model is complex, it's not uncommon to use several model objects to
store different aspects of the state.</p>
   
</subsection>
   
<subsection id="GUI2.4.3" title="Tables and TableModels">
   
<p>Like a <classname>JList</classname>, a <classname>JTable</classname> displays
a collection of items to the user.  However, tables are much more complicated
than lists.  Perhaps the most important difference is that it is possible for
the user to edit items in the table.  Table items are arranged in a grid
of rows and columns.  Each grid position is called a <newword>cell</newword> of
the table.  Each column can have a <newword>header</newword>, which
appears at the top of the column and contains a name for the column.</p>

<p>It is easy to create a <classname>JTable</classname> from an array
that contains the names of the columns and a two-dimensional array that
contains the items that go into the cells of the table.  As an
example, the sample program <sourceref href="StatesAndCapitalsTableDemo.java"/>
creates a table with two columns named "State" and "Capital City."  The first
column contains a list of the states of the United States and the second
column contains the name of the capital city of each state.  The table
can be created as follows:</p> 

<pre>String[][] statesAndCapitals = new String[][] {
           { "Alabama", "Montgomery" },
           { "Alaska", "Juneau" },
           { "Arizona", "Phoenix" },
                .
                .
                .
           { "Wisconsin", "Madison" },
           { "Wyoming", "Cheyenne" }
        };

String[] columnHeads = new String[] { "State", "Capital City" };
   
JTable table = new JTable(statesAndCapitals, columnHeads);</pre>
   
<np>Since a table does not come with its own scroll bars, it is almost
always placed in a <classname>JScrollPane</classname> to make it possible
to scroll the table.  For example:</np>
   
<pre>add( new JScrollPane(table), BorderLayout.CENTER );</pre>  
   
<np>The column headers of a <classname>JTable</classname> are not actually part of the table;
they are in a separate component.  But when you add the table to a
<classname>JScrollPane</classname>, the column headers are automatically placed
at the top of the pane.</np>

<p>Using the default settings, the user can edit any cell in the table by
clicking that cell.  When editing a cell, the arrow keys
can be used to move from one cell to another.
The user can change the order of the columns by
dragging a column header to a new position.  The user can also change the
width of the columns by dragging the line that separates neighboring
column headers.  You can try all this in 
<sourceref href="StatesAndCapitalsTableDemo.java"/>.</p>
   
<p>Allowing the user to edit all entries in the table is not always appropriate;
certainly it's not appropriate in the "states and capitals" example.  A <classname>JTable</classname>
uses an object of type <classname>TableModel</classname> to store information about the
contents of the table.  The model object is also responsible for deciding whether or not the
user should be able to edit any given cell in the table.  <classname>TableModel</classname>
includes the method</p>
   
<pre>public boolean isCellEditable(int rowNum, columnNum)</pre>
   
<np>where <code>rowNum</code> and <code>columnNum</code> are the position of a cell
in the grid of rows and columns that make up the table.
When the controller wants to know whether a certain cell is editable, it
calls this method in the table model.  If the return value is true, the user is allowed
to edit the cell.</np>
   
<p>The default model that is used when the table is created from an array of 
objects allows editing of all cells.  For this model, the return value of
<code>isCellEditable()</code> is true in all cases.
To make some cells non-editable, you have to provide a different model for the table.
One way to do this is to create a subclass of <classname>DefaultTableModel</classname>
and override the <code>isCellEditable()</code> method.  (<classname>DefaultTableModel</classname>
and some other classes that are discussed in this section are defined in the
package <code>javax.swing.table</code>.)  Here is how this might have been
done in the "states and capitals" program to make all cells non-editable:</p>
   
<pre>TableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(statesAndCapitals,columnHeads) {
   public boolean isCellEditable(int row, int col) {
      return false;
   }
};
JTable table = new JTable(model);</pre>
   
<np>Here, an anonymous subclass of <classname>DefaultTableModel</classname> is
created in which the <code>isCellEditable()</code> method returns <code>false</code> in
all cases, and the model object that is created from that class is passed as a parameter
to the <classname>JTable</classname> constructor.</np>
   
<p>The <classname>DefaultTableModel</classname> class defines many methods
that can be used to modify the table, including for example:
<code>setValueAt(item,rowNum,colNum)</code>
to change the item in a given cell; <code>removeRow(rowNum)</code> to delete a row; and
<code>addRow(itemArray)</code> to add a new row at the end of the table that contains
items from the array <code>itemArray</code>.  Note that if the item
in a given cell is set to <code>null</code>, then that cell will be empty.
Remember, again, that when you modify the model, the view is automatically
updated to reflect the changes.</p>
   
<p>In addition to the <code>isCellEditable()</code> method, the table model method
that you are most likely to want to override is <code>getColumnClass()</code>,
which is defined as</p>

<pre>public Class&lt;?&gt; getColumnClass(columnNum)</pre>
   
<np>The purpose of this method is to specify what kind of values are allowed in the
specified column.  The return value from this method is of type <classname>Class</classname>.
(The "<code>&lt;?&gt;</code>" is there for technical reasons having to do with generic programming.
See <localref href="generics.5"/>, but don't worry about understanding it here.)
Although class objects have crept into this book in a few places&mdash;in the discussion of
<classname>ClassLoaders</classname> in <localref href="GUI2.1.3"/> for example&mdash;this is
the first time we have directly encountered the class named <classname>Class</classname>.
An object of type <classname>Class</classname> represents a class.  A <classname>Class</classname>
object is usually obtained from the name of the class using expressions of the form
"<code>Double.class</code>" or "<code>JTable.class</code>".  If you want a three-column
table in which the column types are <classname>String</classname>, <classname>Double</classname>,
and <classname>Boolean</classname>, you can use a table model in which
<code>getColumnClass</code> is defined as:</np>
   
<pre>public Class&lt;?&gt; getColumnClass(columnNum) {
   if (columnNum == 0)
      return String.class;
   else if (columnNum == 1)
      return Double.class;
   else
      return Boolean.class;
}</pre>
   
<np>The table will call this method and use the return value to decide how
to display and edit items in the table.  For example, if a column is specified
to hold <classname>Boolean</classname> values, the cells in that column will be displayed and
edited as check boxes.  For numeric types, the table will not accept
illegal input when the user types in the value.  (It is possible to change
the way that a table edits or displays items.  See the methods
<code>setDefaultEditor()</code> and <code>setDefaultRenderer()</code> 
in the <classname>JTable</classname> class.)</np>
      
<p>As an alternative to using a subclass of <classname>DefaultTableModel</classname>,
a custom table model can also be defined using a subclass of <classname>AbstractTableModel</classname>.
Whereas <classname>DefaultTableModel</classname> provides a lot of predefined functionality,
<classname>AbstractTableModel</classname> provides very little.  However, using
<classname>AbstractTableModel</classname> gives you the freedom to represent the table
data any way you want.  The sample program <sourceref href="ScatterPlotTableDemo.java"/>
uses a subclass of <classname>AbstractTableModel</classname> to define the model for a
<classname>JTable</classname>.  In this program, the table has three columns.  The
first column holds a row number and is not editable.  The other columns hold values
of type <classname>Double</classname>; these two columns represent the x- and y-coordinates
of points in the plane.  The points themselves are graphed in a "scatter plot" next
to the table.  Initially, the program fills in the first six points with random values.
Here is a picture of the program, with the x-coordinate in row 5 selected for
editing:</p>
   
<img src="scatter-plot-demo.png" width="570" height="324" alt="User inputs xy-points with a JTable"
      tex="scatter-plot-demo.eps" texscale="0.6"/>
   
<p>Note, by the way, that in this program, the scatter plot can be considered to be
a view of the table model, in the same way that the table itself is.  The scatter
plot registers itself as a listener with the model, so that it will receive notification
whenever the model changes.  When that happens, the scatter plot redraws itself to
reflect the new state of the model.  It is an important property of the MVC pattern
that several views can share the same model, offering alternative presentations of the
same data.  The views don't have to know about each other or communicate with each other except 
by sharing the model.  Although I didn't do it in this program, it would even be
possible to add a controller to the scatter plot view.  This could let the user
add a point by clicking the mouse on the scatter plot
or drag a point to change its coordinates.  The controller would update the table
model, based on the user actions.  Since the scatter plot
and table share the same model, the values displayed in the table would automatically change to
match.</p>
   
<p>Here is the definition of the class that defines the model in the scatter plot
program.  All the methods in this class must be defined in any subclass of
<classname>AbstractTableModel</classname> except for <code>setValueAt()</code>,
which only has to be defined if the table is modifiable.</p>
   
<pre>/**
 * This class defines the TableModel that is used for the JTable in this
 * program.  The table has three columns.  Column 0 simply holds the
 * row number of each row.  Column 1 holds the x-coordinates of the
 * points for the scatter plot, and Column 2 holds the y-coordinates.
 * The table has 25 rows.  No support is provided for adding more rows.
 */
private class CoordInputTableModel extends AbstractTableModel {
   
   private Double[] xCoord = new Double[25];  // Data for Column 1.
   private Double[] yCoord = new Double[25];  // Data for Column 2.
        // Initially, all the values in the array are null, which means
        // that all the cells are empty.
   
   public int getColumnCount() {  // Tells caller how many columns there are.

         return "X";
      else
         return "Y";
   }

   public boolean isCellEditable(int row, int col) { // Can user edit cell?
      return col > 0;
   }
   
   public void setValueAt(Object obj, int row, int col) { 
         // (This method is called by the system if the value of the cell
         // needs to be changed because the user has edited the cell.
         // It can also be called to change the value programmatically.
         // In this case, only columns 1 and 2 can be modified, and the data
         // type for obj must be Double.  The method fireTableCellUpdated()
         // has to be called to send an event to registered listeners to
         // notify them of the modification to the table model.)
      if (col == 1) 
         xCoord[row] = (Double)obj;
      else if (col == 2)
         yCoord[row] = (Double)obj;
      fireTableCellUpdated(row, col);
   }
   
}  // end nested class CoordInputTableModel</pre>
   
<p>In addition to defining a custom table model, I customized the appearance of the
table in several ways.  Because this involves changes to the view, most of the changes
are made by calling methods in the <classname>JTable</classname> object.  For example,
since the default height of the cells was too small for my
taste, I called <code>table.setRowHeight(25)</code> to increase the height.
To make lines appear between the rows and columns, I found that I had to call
both <code>table.setShowGrid(true)</code> and <code>table.setGridColor(Color.BLACK)</code>.
Some of the customization has to be done to other objects.  For example, to
prevent the user from changing the order of the columns by dragging the column
headers, I had to use</p>
   
<pre>table.getTableHeader().setReorderingAllowed(false);</pre>
   
<np>Tables are quite complex, and I have only discussed a part of the
table API here.  Nevertheless, I hope that you have learned enough to
start using them and to learn more about them on your own.</np>
   
</subsection>   
   
<subsection id="GUI2.4.4" title="Documents and Editors">
   
<p>As a final example of complex components, we look briefly at <classname>JTextComponent</classname>
and its subclasses.  A <classname>JTextComponent</classname> displays text that can,
optionally, be edited by the user.  Two subclasses, <classname>JTextField</classname> and
<classname>JTextArea</classname>, were introduced in <localref href="GUI1.6.4"/>.
But the real complexity comes in another subclass, <classname>JEditorPane</classname>,
that supports display and editing of styled text.  This allows features such as boldface
and italic.  A <classname>JEditorPane</classname> can even work with basic HTML
documents.</p>
      
<p>It is almost absurdly easy to write a simple web browser program using a
<classname>JEditorPane</classname> (although the program that you get can
only handle basic web pages and does a pretty bad job on many modern web pages).
This is done in the sample program
<sourceref href="SimpleWebBrowser.java"/>.  In this program, the user enters
the URL of a web page, and the program tries to load and display the web page
at that location.  A <classname>JEditorPane</classname> can handle pages with
content type "text/plain", "text/html", and "text/rtf".  (The content type
"text/rtf" represents styled or "rich text format" text.  URLs and
content types were covered in <localref href="IO.4.1"/>.)  If <code>editPane</code>
is of type <classname>JEditorPane</classname> and <code>url</code> is of type
<classname>URL</classname>, then the statement "<code>editPane.setPage(url);</code>"
is sufficient to load the page and display it.  Since this can generate an
exception, the following method is used in <sourceref href="SimpleWebBrowser.java"/>
to display a page:</p>
   
<pre>private void loadURL(URL url) {
   try {
      editPane.setPage(url);
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
      editPane.setContentType("text/plain"); // Set pane to display plain text.
      editPane.setText( "Sorry, the requested document was not found\n"
            +"or cannot be displayed.\n\nError:" + e);
   }
}</pre>
   
<p>An HTML document can include links to other pages.  When the user clicks on a link, the
web browser should go to the linked page.  A <classname>JEditorPane</classname> does
not do this automatically, but it does generate an event of type <classname>HyperLinkEvent</classname>
when the user clicks a link (provided that the edit pane has been set to be
non-editable by the user).  A program can register a listener for such events and
respond by loading the new page.</p>
   
<p>There are a lot of web pages that a <classname>JEditorPane</classname> won't be able 
to display correctly, but it can be very useful in cases where you have control over
the pages that will be displayed.  A nice application is to distribute HTML-format
help and information files with a program.  The files can be stored as resource
files in the jar file of the program, and a URL for a resource file can be obtained
in the usual way, using the <code>getResource()</code> method of a <classname>ClassLoader</classname>.
(See <localref href="GUI2.1.3"/>.)</p>
   
<p>It turns out, by the way, that <sourceref href="SimpleWebBrowser.java"/> is a
little too simple.  A modified version, <sourceref href="SimpleWebBrowserWithThread.java"/>,
improves on the original by using a thread to load a page and by checking the
content type of a page before trying to load it.  It actually does work as a
simple web browser.  Try it!</p>
   
<p>The model for a <classname>JTextComponent</classname> is an object of type
<classname>Document</classname>.  If you want to be notified of changes in the
model, you can add a listener to the model using</p>
   
<pre>textComponent.getDocument().addDocumentListener(listener)</pre>

<np>where <code>textComponent</code> is of type <classname>JTextComponent</classname>
and <code>listener</code> is of type <classname>DocumentListener</classname>. The
<classname>Document</classname> class also has methods that make it easy to
read a document from a file and write a document to a file.  I won't discuss
all the things you can do with text components here.  For one more peek at their
capabilities, see the sample program <sourceref href="SimpleRTFEdit.java"/>,
a very minimal editor for files that contain styled text of type "text/rtf."</np>

<subsection id="GUI2.4.5" title="Custom Components">
   
<p>Java's standard component classes are usually all you need to construct a user
interface. At some point, however, you might need a component that Java doesn't provide.
In that case, you can write your own component class, building on one of the
components that Java does provide. We've already done this, actually, every
time we've written a subclass of the <classname>JPanel</classname> class to use as a drawing
surface. A <classname>JPanel</classname> is a blank slate. By defining a subclass, you can
make it show any picture you like, and you can program it to respond in any way
to mouse and keyboard events. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you don't need such
freedom, and you can build on one of Java's more sophisticated component
classes.</p>

<p>For example, suppose I have a need for a "stopwatch" component. When the
user clicks on the stopwatch, I want it to start timing. When the user clicks
again, I want it to display the elapsed time since the first click. The textual
display can be done with a <classname>JLabel</classname>, but we want 
a <classname>JLabel</classname> that
can respond to mouse clicks. We can get this behavior by defining a
<classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> component as a subclass of the <classname>JLabel</classname> class. A
<classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> object will listen for mouse clicks on itself. The first
time the user clicks, it will change its display to "Timing..." and remember
the time when the click occurred. When the user clicks again, it will check the
time again, and it will compute and display the elapsed time. (Of course, I
don't necessarily have to define a subclass. I could use a regular label in my
program, set up a listener to respond to mouse events on the label, and let the
program do the work of keeping track of the time and changing the text displayed
on the label. However, by writing a new class, I have something that can be
<b>reused</b> in other projects. I also have all the code involved in the stopwatch
function collected together neatly in one place. For more complicated
components, both of these considerations are very important.)</p>

<p>The <classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> class is not very hard to write. I need an instance
variable to record the time when the user starts the stopwatch. Times in Java
are measured in milliseconds and are stored in variables of type <ptype>long</ptype>
(to allow for very large values). In the <code>mousePressed()</code> method, I need
to know whether the timer is being started or stopped, so I need a <ptype>boolean</ptype>
instance variable, <code>running</code>, to keep track of this aspect of the component's state. There
is one more item of interest: How do I know what time the mouse was clicked?
The method <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> returns the current time. But
there can be some delay between the time the user clicks the mouse and the time
when the <code>mousePressed()</code> routine is called. To make my stopwatch as
accurate as possible, I don't want to know the
current time. I want to know the exact time when the mouse was pressed. When I
wrote the <classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> class, this need sent me on a search in the Java
documentation. I found that if <code>evt</code> is an object of type
<classname>MouseEvent</classname>, then the function <code>evt.getWhen()</code> returns the
time when the event occurred. I call this function in the
<code>mousePressed()</code> routine to determine the exact time when the user
clicked on the label. The complete <code>StopWatch</code> class is rather short:</p>

<pre>import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;

/**
 * A custom component that acts as a simple stop-watch.  When the user clicks
 * on it, this component starts timing.  When the user clicks again,
 * it displays the time between the two clicks.  Clicking a third time
 * starts another timer, etc.  While it is timing, the label just
 * displays the message "Timing....".
 */
public class StopWatchLabel extends JLabel implements MouseListener {

   private long startTime;   // Start time of timer.
                             //   (Time is measured in milliseconds.)

   private boolean running;  // True when the timer is running.

   /**
    * Constructor sets initial text on the label to
    * "Click to start timer." and sets up a mouse listener
    * so the label can respond to clicks.
    */
   public StopWatchLabel() {
      super("  Click to start timer.  ", JLabel.CENTER);
      addMouseListener(this);
   }
   
   
   /**
    * Tells whether the timer is currently running.
    */
   public boolean isRunning() {
      return running;
   }
   
   
   /**
    * React when the user presses the mouse by starting or stopping
    * the timer and changing the text that is shown on the label.
    */
   public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) {
      if (running == false) {
            // Record the time and start the timer.
         running = true;
         startTime = evt.getWhen();  // Time when mouse was clicked.
         setText("Timing....");
      }
      else {
            // Stop the timer.  Compute the elapsed time since the
            // timer was started and display it.
         running = false;
         long endTime = evt.getWhen();
         double seconds = (endTime - startTime) / 1000.0;
         setText("Time: " + seconds + " sec.");
      }
   }
   
   public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) { }
   public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent evt) { }
   public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent evt) { }
   public void mouseExited(MouseEvent evt) { }

}</pre>

<p>Don't forget that since <classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> is a subclass of <classname>JLabel</classname>,
you can do anything with a <classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> that you can do with a
<classname>JLabel</classname>. You can add it to a container. You can set its font,
foreground color, and background color. You can set the text that it displays
(although this would interfere with its stopwatch function). You can even add a
<classname>Border</classname> if you want.</p>

<p>Let's look at one more example of defining a custom component. Suppose that&mdash;for 
no good reason whatsoever&mdash;I want a component that acts like a
<classname>JLabel</classname> except that it displays its text in mirror-reversed form. Since
no standard component does anything like this, the <classname>MirrorText</classname> class
is defined as a subclass of <classname>JPanel</classname>. It has a constructor that
specifies the text to be displayed and a <code>setText()</code> method that changes
the displayed text. The <code>paintComponent()</code> method draws the text
mirror-reversed, in the center of the component. This uses techniques discussed
in <localref href="GUI2.1.1"/> and <localref href="GUI2.2.1"/>.
Information from a <classname>FontMetrics</classname>
object is used to center the text in the component. The reversal is achieved by
using an off-screen canvas. The text is drawn to the off-screen canvas, in the
usual  way. Then the image is copied to the screen with the following command,
where <code>OSC</code> is the variable that refers to the off-screen canvas,
and <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> give the size of both the
component and the off-screen canvas:</p>

<pre>g.drawImage(OSC, width, 0, 0, height, 0, 0, width, height, null);</pre>

<p>This is the version of <code>drawImage()</code> that specifies corners of
destination and source rectangles. The corner <code>(0,0)</code> in <code>OSC</code> is
matched to the corner <code>(width,0)</code> on the screen, while
<code>(width,height)</code> is matched to <code>(0,height)</code>. This
reverses the image left-to-right. Here is the complete class:</p>

<pre>import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

/**
 * A component for displaying a mirror-reversed line of text.
 * The text will be centered in the available space.  This component
 * is defined as a subclass of JPanel.  It respects any background 
 * color, foreground color, and font that are set for the JPanel.
 * The setText(String) method can be used to change the displayed
 * text.  Changing the text will also call revalidate() on this
 * component.
 */
public class MirrorText extends JPanel {

   private String text; // The text displayed by this component.
   
   private BufferedImage OSC; // Holds an un-reversed picture of the text.

   /**
    * Construct a MirrorText component that will display the specified
    * text in mirror-reversed form.
    */
   public MirrorText(String text) {
      if (text == null)
         text = "";
      this.text = text;
   }
   
   /**
    * Change the text that is displayed on the label.
    * @param text the new text to display
    */
   public void setText(String text) {
      if (text == null)
         text = "";
      if ( ! text.equals(this.text) ) {
         this.text = text;  // Change the instance variable.
         revalidate();      // Tell container to recompute its layout.
         repaint();         // Make sure component is redrawn.
      }
   }
   
   /**
    * Return the text that is displayed on this component.
    * The return value is non-null but can be an empty string.
    */
   public String getText() {
      return text;
   }

   /**
    * The paintComponent method makes a new off-screen canvas, if necessary,
    * writes the text to the off-screen canvas, then copies the canvas onto
    * the screen in mirror-reversed form.
    */
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
      int width = getWidth();
      int height = getHeight();
      if (OSC == null || width != OSC.getWidth() 
                          || height != OSC.getHeight()) {
         OSC = new BufferedImage(width,height,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
      }
      Graphics OSG = OSC.getGraphics();
      OSG.setColor(getBackground());
      OSG.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
      OSG.setColor(getForeground()); 
      OSG.setFont(getFont());
      FontMetrics fm = OSG.getFontMetrics(getFont());
      int x = (width - fm.stringWidth(text)) / 2;
      int y = (height + fm.getAscent() - fm.getDescent()) / 2;
      OSG.drawString(text, x, y);
      OSG.dispose();
      g.drawImage(OSC, width, 0, 0, height, 0, 0, width, height, null);
   }

   /**
    * Compute a preferred size that includes the size of the text, plus
    * a boundary of 5 pixels on each edge.
    */
   public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
      FontMetrics fm = getFontMetrics(getFont());
      return new Dimension(fm.stringWidth(text) + 10, 
            fm.getAscent() + fm.getDescent() + 10);
   }

}  // end MirrorText</pre>

<p>This class defines the method "<code>public Dimension
getPreferredSize()</code>". This method is called by a layout manager when it
wants to know how big the component would like to be. Standard components come
with a way of computing a preferred size. For a custom component based on a
<classname>JPanel</classname>, it's a good idea to provide a custom preferred size. 
Every component has a method <code>setPreferredSize()</code> that can 
be used to set the preferred size of the component. 
For our <classname>MirrorText</classname> component, however, the preferred size
depends on the font and the text of the component, and these can change from time
to time. We need a way to compute a preferred size on demand, based on the
current font and text. That's what we do by defining a
<code>getPreferredSize()</code> method. The system calls this method when it wants
to know the preferred size of the component. In response, we can compute the
preferred size based on the current font and text.</p>

<p>The <classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> and <classname>MirrorText</classname> classes define components.
Components don't stand on their own. You have to add them to a panel or other
container.  The sample program <sourceref href="CustomComponentTest.java"/>
demonstrates using a <classname>MirrorText</classname> and a
<classname>StopWatchLabel</classname> component, which
are defined by the source code files <sourceref href="MirrorText.java"/> and 
<sourceref href="StopWatchLabel.java"/>.</p>

<p>In this program, the two custom components and a button are added to a
panel that uses a <classname>FlowLayout</classname> as its layout manager, 
so the components are not arranged very neatly. 
If you click the button labeled "Change Text in this Program", 
the text in all the components will be changed. You can also
click on the stopwatch label to start and stop the stopwatch. When you do any
of these things, you will notice that the components will be rearranged to take
the new sizes into account. This is known as "validating" the container. This
is done automatically when a standard component changes in some way that
requires a change in preferred size or location. This may or may not be the
behavior that you want. (Validation doesn't always cause as much disruption as
it does in this program.  For example, in a <classname>GridLayout</classname>, where all the
components are displayed at the same size, it will have no effect at all. I
chose a <classname>FlowLayout</classname> for this example to make the effect more obvious.)
When the text is changed in a <classname>MirrorText</classname> component,
there is no automatic validation of its container.
A custom component such as <classname>MirrorText</classname> must call the
<code>revalidate()</code> method to indicate that the container that contains the
component should be validated. In the <classname>MirrorText</classname> class,
<code>revalidate()</code> is called in the <code>setText()</code> method.</p>
