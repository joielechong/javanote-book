<section id="threads.3" title="Threads and Parallel Processing">

<p><start><b>T</b>he example in</start> <localref href="threads.2.4"/> in
the previous section used parallel processing to execute pieces of a large task.  On a computer that 
has several processors, this allows the computation to be
completed more quickly.  However, the way that the program divided up the
computation into subtasks was not optimal.  Nor was the way that the threads were managed.
In this section, we will look at two more versions of that program.  The first
improves the way the problem is decomposed into subtasks.  The second improves
the way threads are used.  Along the way, I'll introduce a couple of built-in classes
that Java provides to support parallel processing.  Later in the section, I will cover
<code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code>, lower-level methods that can be used to
control parallel processes more directly.</p>


<subsection id="threads.3.1" title="Problem Decomposition">

<p>The sample program <sourceref href="MultiprocessingDemo1.java"/> divides the task of
computing an image into several subtasks and assigns each subtask to a thread. While this
works OK, there is a problem: Some of the subtasks might take substantially longer than
others. The program divides the image up into equal parts, but the fact is that some
parts of the image require more computation than others.  In fact, if you run the program
with three threads, you'll notice that the middle piece takes longer to compute than the
top or bottom piece.  In general, when dividing a problem into subproblems, it is very hard
to predict just how much time it will take to solve each subproblem.  Let's say that
one particular subproblem happens to take a lot longer than all the others.  The thread
that computes that subproblem will continue to run for a relatively long time after all 
the other threads have completed. During that time, only <b>one</b> of the
computer's processors will be working; the rest will be idle.</p>

<p>As a simple example, suppose that your computer has two processors.  You divide the
problem into two subproblems and create a thread to run each subproblem  Your hope is
that by using both processors, you can get your answer in half the time that it would
take when using one processor.  But if one subproblem takes four times longer than
the other to solve, then for most of the time, only one processor will be working.
In this case, you will only have cut the time needed to get your answer by&nbsp;20%.</p>

<p>Even if you manage to divide your problem into subproblems that require equal
amounts of computation, you still can't depend on all the subproblems requiring
equal amounts of time to solve.  For example, some of the processors
on your computer might be busy running other programs.  Or perhaps some of the processors
are simply slower than others.  (This is not so likely when running your computation on 
a single computer, but when distributing computation across several networked
computers, as we will do later in this chapter, differences in processor speed 
can be a major issue.)</p>

<p>The common technique for dealing with all this is to divide the problem into
a fairly large number of subproblems&mdash;many more subproblems than there are
processors.  This means that each processor will have to solve several subproblems. 
Each time a processor completes one subtask, it is assigned another subtask
to work on, until all the subtasks have been assigned.   Of course, there will 
still be variation in the time that the various subtasks require.  One processor
might complete several subproblems while another works on one particularly difficult
case.  And a slow or busy processor might complete only one or two subproblems 
while another processor finishes five or six.  Each processor can work at its
own pace. As long as the subproblems are fairly small, most of the processors can 
be kept busy until near the end of the computation.  This is known as <newword>load
balancing</newword>:  the computational load is balanced among the available processors
in order to keep them all as busy as possible.  Of course, some processors
will still finish before others, but not by longer than the time it takes to
complete the longest subtask.</p>

<p>While the subproblems should be small, they should not be <b>too</b> small.  There
is some computational overhead involved in creating the subproblems and assigning them
to processors.  If the subproblems are very small, this overhead can add significantly
to the total amount of work that has to be done.  In my example program, the task is
to compute a color for each pixel in an image.  For dividing that task up into subtasks,
one possibility would be to have each subtask compute just one pixel.  But the subtasks
produced in that way are probably too small.  So, instead, each subtask in my program
will compute the colors for one row of pixels.  Since there are several hundred
rows of pixels in the image, the number of subtasks will be fairly large, while each
subtask will also be fairly large.  The result is fairly good load balancing, with
a reasonable amount of overhead.</p> 

<p>Note, by the way, that the problem that we are working on is a very easy one
for parallel programming.  When we divide the problem of calculating an image into 
subproblems, all the subproblems are completely independent.  It is possible to
work on any number of them simultaneously, and they can be done in any order.
Things get a lot more complicated when some subtasks produce results that
are required by other subtasks.  In that case, the subtasks are not independent,
and the order in which the subtasks are performed is important.  Furthermore,
there has to be some way for results from one subtask to be shared with other
tasks.  When the subtasks are executed by different threads, this raises all
the issues involved in controlling access of threads to shared resources.  So,
in general, decomposing a problem for parallel processing is much more difficult
than it might appear from our relatively simple example.  But for the most part,
that's a topic for a course in distributed computing, not an introductory
programming course.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection id="threads.3.2" title="Thread Pools and Task Queues">

<p>Once we have decided how to decompose a task into subtasks, there is the question of
how to assign those subtasks to threads.  Typically, in an object-oriented approach,
each subtask will be represented 
by an object.  Since a task represents some computation, it's natural for the
object that represents it to have an instance method that does the computation.
To execute the task, it is only necessary to call its computation method.  In my
program, the computation method is called <code>run()</code> and the task object
implements the standard <classname>Runnable</classname> interface that was discussed in
<localref href="threads.1.1"/>.  This interface is a natural way to represent computational tasks.
It's possible to create a new thread for each <classname>Runnable</classname>.
However, that doesn't really make sense when there are
many tasks, since there is a significant amount of overhead involved in
creating each new thread.  A better alternative is to create just a few threads and let
each thread execute a number of tasks.</p>

<p>The optimal number of threads to use is not entirely clear, and it can depend on
exactly what problem you are trying to solve.  The goal is to keep all of the computer's
processors busy.  In the image-computing example, it works well to create one thread 
for each available processor, but that won't be true for all problems.  In particular,
if a thread can block for a non-trivial amount of time while waiting for some event or 
for access to some resource, you want to have extra threads around for the processor to 
run while other threads are blocked.  We'll encounter exactly that situation when
we turn to using threads with networking in <localref href="threads.4"/>.</p>

<p>When several threads are available for performing tasks, those threads are called
a <newword>thread pool</newword>.  Thread pools are used to avoid creating a new
thread to perform each task.  Instead, when a task needs to be performed, it can
be assigned to any idle thread in the "pool."</p>

<p>Once all the threads in the thread pool are busy, any additional tasks will have
to wait until one of the threads becomes idle.  This is a natural application for
a queue:  Associated with the thread pool is a queue of waiting tasks.  As tasks
become available, they are added to the queue.  Every time that a thread finishes
a task, it goes to the queue to get another task to work on.</p>

<p>Note that there is only one task queue for the thread pool.
All the threads in the pool use the same queue, so the queue is a shared resource.
As always with shared resources, race conditions are possible and synchronization
is essential.  Without synchronization, for example, it is possible that two threads trying
to get items from the queue at the same time will end up retrieving the same item.
(See if you can spot the race conditions in the <code>dequeue()</code> method in
<localref href="recursion.3.2"/>.)</p>

<p>Java has a built-in class to solve this problem:
<classname>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</classname>.  This class and others that can 
be useful in parallel programming are defined in the package <code>java.util.concurrent</code>.
It is a parameterized class so that to create a queue that can hold objects
of type <classname>Runnable</classname>, you can say</p>

<pre>ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;();</pre>

<np>This class represents a queue, implemented as a linked list, in which operations
on the queue are properly synchronized.  The operations on a <classname>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</classname>
are not exactly the queue operations that we are used to.  The method for adding a new
item, <code>x</code>, to the end of <code>queue</code> is <codedef>queue.add(x)</codedef>.  The method for
removing an item from the front of <code>queue</code> is <codedef>queue.poll()</codedef>.  The
<code>queue.poll()</code> method returns <code>null</code> if the queue is empty; thus, <code>poll()</code>
can be used to test whether the queue is empty and to retrieve an item if it is not.  It makes sense
to do things in this way because testing whether the queue is non-empty before taking
an item from the queue involves a race condition: Without synchronization, it is possible for another thread
to remove the last item from the queue between the time when you check that the queue is 
non-empty and the time when you try to take the item from the queue.  By the time you try
to get the item, there's nothing there!</np>

<break/>

<p>To use <classname>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</classname> in our image-computing example,
we can use the queue along with a thread pool.  To begin the computation of the image,
we create all the tasks that make up the image and add them to the queue.  
Then, we can create and start the worker threads that will execute the tasks. Each thread will
run in a loop in which it gets one task from the queue, by calling the queue's <code>poll()</code>
method, and carries out that task.  Since
the task is an object of type <classname>Runnable</classname>, it is only necessary
for the thread to call the task's <code>run()</code> method.  When the <code>poll()</code>
method returns <code>null</code>, the queue is empty and the thread can terminate because
all the tasks have been assigned to threads.</p>

<p>The sample program <sourceref href="MultiprocessingDemo2.java"/> implements this idea.
It uses a queue <code>taskQueue</code> of type <classname>ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;</classname>
to hold the tasks.  In addition, in order to allow the user to abort the computation before it
finishes, it uses the <code>volatile</code> <ptype>boolean</ptype> variable <code>running</code>
to signal the thread when the user aborts the computation.  The thread should terminate
when this variable is set to <code>false</code>.  The threads are defined by a nested
class named <classname>WorkerThread</classname>.  It is quite short and simple to write
at this point:</p>


<pre>private class WorkerThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            while (running) {
                Runnable task = taskQueue.poll(); // Get a task from the queue.
                if (task == null)
                    break; // (because the queue is empty)
                task.run();  // Execute the task;
            }
        }
        finally {
            threadFinished(); // Records fact that this thread has terminated.
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>The program uses a nested class named <code>MandelbrotTask</code> to represent the task
of computing one row of pixels in the image.  This class implements the <classname>Runnable</classname>
interface.  Its <code>run()</code> method does the actual work:  Compute the color
of each pixel, and apply the colors to the image.  Here is what the program does to start the
computation (with a few details omitted):</p>

<pre>taskQueue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;(); // Create the queue.
int height = ... ; // Number of rows in the image.
for (int row = 0; row &lt; height; row++) {
    MandelbrotTask task;
    task = ... ;  // Create a task to compute one row of the image.
    taskQueue.add(task); // Add the task to the queue.
}

int threadCount = ... ; // Number of threads in the pool
workers = new WorkerThread[threadCount];
running = true;  // Set the signal before starting the threads!
threadsCompleted = 0;  // Records how many of the threads have terminated.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; threadCount; i++) {
    workers[i] = new WorkerThread();
    try {
        workers[i].setPriority( Thread.currentThread().getPriority() - 1 );
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
    }
    workers[i].start();
}</pre>

<np>Note that it is important that the tasks be added to the queue <b>before</b>
the threads are started.  The threads see an empty queue as a signal to terminate.
If the queue is empty when the threads are started, they might see an empty queue
and terminate immediately after being started, without performing any tasks!</np>

<p>You should try out <code>MultiprocessingDemo2</code>.
It computes the same image as <code>MultiprocessingDemo1</code>, but the rows of pixels are
not computed in the same order as in that program (if there is more than one thread).  
If you look carefully,
you might see that the rows of pixels are not added to the image in strict order from
top to bottom.  This is because it is possible for one thread to finish row number
<code>i+1</code> while another thread is still working on row <code>i</code>, or even
earlier rows.  (The effect might be more apparent if you use more threads than
you have processors.  Try it with 20 threads.)</p>

</subsection>




<subsection id="threads.3.3" title="Producer/Consumer and Blocking Queues">

<p><code>MultiprocessingDemo2</code> creates an entirely new thread pool every 
time it draws an image.  This seems wasteful.  Shouldn't it be possible to create
one set of threads at the beginning of the program and use them whenever an
image needs to be computed?  After all, the idea of a thread pool is that the
threads should sit around and wait for tasks to come along and should execute
them when they do.  The problem is that, so far, we have no way to make a
thread <i>wait</i> for a task to come along.  To do that, we will use something
called a <newword>blocking queue</newword>.</p>

<p>A blocking queue is an implementation of one of the classic patterns in
parallel processing: the <newword>producer/consumer</newword> pattern.
This pattern arises when there are one or more "producers" who produce things
and one or more "consumers" who consume those things.  All the producers and
consumers should be able to work simultaneously (hence, parallel processing).
If there are no things ready to be processed, a consumer will have to wait
until one is produced.  In many applications, producers also have to wait
sometimes:  If things can only be consumed at a rate of, say, one per minute,
it doesn't make sense for the producers to produce them indefinitely at a
rate of two per minute.  That would just lead to an unlimited build-up of
things waiting to be processed.  Therefore, it's often useful to put a limit
on the number of things that can be waiting for processing.  When that limit
is reached, producers should wait before producing more things.</p>

<p>We need a way to get the things from the producers to the consumers.  A queue
is an obvious answer:  Producers place items into the queue as they
are produced.  Consumers remove items from the other end of the queue.</p>

<img src="producer-consumer.png" width="495" height="202" alt="producers and consumers connected by a queue" 
     tex="producer-consumer.eps" texscale="0.6"/>

<p>We are talking parallel processing, so we need a synchronized queue, but
we need more than that.  When the queue is empty, we need a way to have
consumers <i>wait</i> until an item appears in the queue.  If the queue
becomes full, we need a way to have producers <i>wait</i> until a space
opens up in the queue.  In our application, the producers and consumers are
threads.  A thread that is suspended, waiting for something to happen, is
said to be blocked, and the type of queue that we need is called
a blocking queue.  In a blocking queue, the operation of dequeueing an
item from the queue can block if the queue is empty.  That is, if a thread
tries to dequeue an item from an empty queue, the thread will be
suspended until an item becomes available; at that time, it will wake up,
retrieve the item, and proceed.  Similarly, if the queue has a limited
capacity, a producer that tries to enqueue an item can block if there
is no space in the queue.</p>

<p>Java has two classes that implement blocking queues: <classname>LinkedBlockingQueue</classname>
and <classname>ArrayBlockingQueue</classname>.  These are parameterized types
to allow you to specify the type of item that the queue can hold.
Both classes are defined in the package
<code>java.util.concurrent</code> and both implement an interface called
<classname>BlockingQueue</classname>.  If <code>bqueue</code> is a blocking
queue belonging to one of these classes, then the following operations are
defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><codedef>bqueue.take()</codedef> -- Removes an item from the queue and
returns it.  If the queue is empty when this method is called, the thread
that called it will block until an item becomes available.  This method 
throws an <classname>InterruptedException</classname> if the thread is
interrupted while it is blocked.</li>
<li><codedef>bqueue.put(item)</codedef> -- Adds the <code>item</code> to the queue.
If the queue has a limited capacity and is full, the thread that called it
will block until a space opens up in the queue. This method 
throws an <classname>InterruptedException</classname> if the thread is
interrupted while it is blocked.</li>
<li><codedef>bqueue.add(item)</codedef> -- Adds the <code>item</code> to the queue,
if space is available.  If the queue has a limited capacity and is full,
an <classname>IllegalStateException</classname> is thrown.  This method
does not block.</li>
<li><codedef>bqueue.clear()</codedef> -- Removes all items from the queue
and discards them.</li>
</ul>

<np>Java's blocking queues define many additional methods (for example, 
<code>bqueue.poll(500)</code> is similar to <code>bqueue.take()</code>,
except that it will not block for longer than 500 milliseconds), but the
four listed here are sufficient for our purposes.  Note that I have
listed two methods for adding items to the queue:  <code>bqueue.put(item)</code>
blocks if there is not space available in the queue and is most appropriate for use
with blocking queues that have a limited capacity; <code>bqueue.add(item)</code>
does not block and is appropriate for use with blocking queues that have an
unlimited capacity.</np>

<p>An <classname>ArrayBlockingQueue</classname> has a maximum capacity that
is specified when it is constructed.  For example, to create a blocking
queue that can hold up to 25  objects of type <classname>ItemType</classname>,
you could say:</p>

<pre>ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;ItemType&gt; bqueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;ItemType&gt;(25);</pre>

<np>With this declaration, <code>bqueue.put(item)</code> will block if <code>bqueue</code>
already contains 25 items, while <code>bqueue.add(item)</code> will throw an exception
in that case.  Recall that this ensures that tasks are not produced indefinitely
at a rate faster than they can be consumed.  A <classname>LinkedBlockingQueue</classname>
is meant for creating blocking queues with unlimited capacity.  For example,</np>

<pre>LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;ItemType&gt; bqueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;ItemType&gt;();</pre>

<np>creates a queue with no upper limit on the number of items that it can contain.
In this case, <code>bqueue.put(item)</code> will never block and <code>bqueue.add(item)</code>
will never throw an <code>IllegalStateException</code>.  You would use a
<classname>LinkedBlockingQueue</classname> when you want to avoid blocking,
and you have some other way of ensuring that the queue will not grow to arbitrary
size.  For both types of blocking queue, <code>bqueue.take()</code> will block
if the queue is empty.</np>

<break/>

<p>The sample program <sourceref href="MultiprocessingDemo3.java"/> uses a
<classname>LinkedBlockingQueue</classname>  in place of the 
<classname>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</classname> in the previous version,
<sourceref href="MultiprocessingDemo2.java"/>.  In this example, the queue
holds tasks, that is, items of type <classname>Runnable</classname>, and
the queue is declared as an instance variable named <code>taskQueue</code>:
</p>

<pre>LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; taskQueue;</pre>

<np>When the user clicks the "Start" button and it's time to compute
an image, all of the tasks that make up the computation are put into this
queue.  This is done by calling <code>taskQueue.add(task)</code> for
each task.  It's important that this can be done without blocking,
since the tasks are created in the event-handling thread, and we don't
want to block that.  The queue cannot grow indefinitely because the program
only works on one image at a time, and there are only a few hundred tasks
per image.</np>

<p>Just as in the previous version of the program, worker threads belonging 
to a thread pool will remove tasks from the queue and carry them out.  However,
in this case, the threads are created once at the beginning of the program&mdash;actually,
the first time the "Start" button is pressed&mdash;and the same threads are
reused for any number of images.  When there are no tasks to execute, the
task queue is empty and the worker threads will block until tasks become available.
Each worker thread runs in an infinite loop, processing tasks forever, but it
will spend a lot of its time blocked, waiting for a task to be added to the 
queue.  Here is the inner class that defines the worker threads:
</p>

<pre>/**
 * This class defines the worker threads that make up the thread pool.
 * A WorkerThread runs in a loop in which it retrieves a task from the 
 * taskQueue and calls the run() method in that task.  Note that if
 * the queue is empty, the thread blocks until a task becomes available
 * in the queue.  The constructor starts the thread, so there is no
 * need for the main program to do so.  The thread will run at a priority
 * that is one less than the priority of the thread that calls the
 * constructor.
 * 
 * A WorkerThread is designed to run in an infinite loop.  It will
 * end only when the Java virtual machine exits. (This assumes that
 * the tasks that are executed don't throw exceptions, which is true
 * in this program.)  The constructor sets the thread to run as
 * a daemon thread; the Java virtual machine will exit automatically when
 * the only threads are daemon threads.  (In this program, this is not
 * necessary since the virtual machine is set to exit when the
 * window is closed.  In a multi-window program, however, we can't
 * simply end the program when a window is closed.)
 */
private class WorkerThread extends Thread {
    WorkerThread() {
        try {
            setPriority( Thread.currentThread().getPriority() - 1);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
        }
        try {
            setDaemon(true);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
        }
        start(); // Thread starts as soon as it is constructed.
    }
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            try {
                Runnable task = taskQueue.take(); // wait for task if necessary
                task.run();
            }
            catch (InterruptedException e) {
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<np>We should look more closely at how the thread pool works.  The worker threads
are created and started before there is any task to perform.  Each thread
immediately calls <code>taskQueue.take()</code>.  Since the task queue is empty,
all the worker threads will block as soon as they are started.  To start the
computation of an image, the event-handling thread will create tasks and
add them to the queue.  As soon as this happens, worker threads will wake
up and start processing tasks, and they will continue doing so until the
queue is emptied.  (Note that on a multi-processor computer, some worker threads 
can start processing even while the event thread is still adding tasks to the queue.)
When the queue is empty, the worker threads will go back to sleep until processing
starts on the next image.</np>

<break/>

<p>An interesting point in this program is that we want to be
able to abort the computation before it finishes, but we don't want
the worker threads to terminate when that happens.  When the user
clicks the "Abort" button, the program calls <code>taskQueue.clear()</code>,
which prevents any more tasks from being assigned to worker threads.
However, some tasks are most likely already being executed when the
task queue is cleared. Those tasks will complete <b>after</b> the
computation in which they are subtasks has supposedly been aborted.
When those subtasks complete, we don't want their output to be
applied to the image.  It's not a big deal in this program, but
in more general applications, we don't want output meant for
a previous computation job to be applied to later jobs.</p>

<p>My solution is to assign a job number to each computation job.  The job number
of the current job is stored in an instance variable named <code>jobNum</code>,
and each task object has an instance variable that tells which task that job is
part of.  When a job ends&mdash;either because the job finishes on its own
or because the user aborts it&mdash;the value of <code>jobNum</code> is
incremented.  When a task completes, the job number stored in the
task object is compared to <code>jobNum</code>.  If they are equal, then the
task is part of the current job, and its output is applied to the image.
If they are not equal, then the task was part of a previous job, and its output
is discarded.</p>

<p>It's important that access to <code>jobNum</code> be properly synchronized.
Otherwise, one thread might check the job number just as another thread is
incrementing it, and output meant for an old job might sneak through
after that job has been aborted.  In the program, all the methods that
access or change <code>jobNum</code> are synchronized.  You can
read the <sourceref href="MultiprocessingDemo3.java">source&nbsp;code</sourceref>
to see how it works.</p>

<break/>

<p>One more point about <code>MultiprocessingDemo3</code>&dots;. I have not provided 
any way to terminate the worker threads in this program.  They will continue to
run until the Java Virtual Machine exits.  To allow thread termination before that,
we could use a <code>volatile</code> signaling variable, <code>running</code>,
and set its value to <code>false</code> when we want the worker threads to terminate.
The <code>run()</code> methods for the threads would be replaced by</p>

<pre>public void run() {
    while ( <newcode>running</newcode> ) {
       try {
          Runnable task = taskQueue.take();
          task.run();
       }
       catch (InterruptedException e) {
       }
    }
}</pre>

<np>However, if a thread is blocked in <code>taskQueue.take()</code>, it
will not see the new value of <code>running</code> until it becomes unblocked.
To ensure that that happens, it is necessary to call <code>worker.interrupt()</code>
for each worker thread <code>worker</code>, just after setting
<code>runner</code> to <code>false</code>.</np>

<p>If a worker thread is executing a task when <code>runner</code> is set to
<code>false</code>, the thread will not terminate until that task has completed.
If the tasks are reasonably short, this is not a problem.  If tasks can take longer
to execute than you are willing to wait for the threads to terminate, then
each task must also check the value of <code>running</code> periodically and
exit when that value becomes <code>false</code>.</p>

<subsection id="threads.3.4" title="Wait and Notify">

<p>To implement a blocking queue, we must be able to make a thread
block just until some event occurs.   The thread is <i>waiting</i>
for the event to occur.  Somehow, it must be <i>notified</i>
when that happens.  There are two threads involved since the
event that will wake one thread is caused by an action taken
by another thread, such as adding an item to the queue.</p>

<p>Note that this is not just an issue for blocking queues.
Whenever one thread produces some sort of result that is needed by
another thread, that imposes some restriction on the order in which the threads
can do their computations.  If the second thread gets to the point where it
needs the result from the first thread, it might have to stop and wait for
the result to be produced.  Since the second thread can't continue, it might
as well go to sleep.  But then there has to be some way to notify the second thread
when the result is ready, so that it can wake up and continue its computation.</p>

<p>Java, of course, has a way to do this kind of "waiting" and "notifying":  It has
<code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code> methods that are defined as
instance methods in class <classname>Object</classname> and so can be used
with any object.  These methods are used internally in blocking queues.
They are fairly low-level, tricky, and error-prone, and you should use
higher-level control strategies such as blocking queues when possible.
However, it's nice to know about <code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code>
in case you ever need to use them directly.</p>

<p>The reason why <code>wait()</code> and
<code>notify()</code> should be associated with objects is not obvious, so
don't worry about it at this point.  It does, at least, make it possible
to direct different notifications to different recipients, depending on
which object's <code>notify()</code> method is called.</p>

<p>The general idea is that when a thread calls a <code>wait()</code> method
in some object, that thread goes to sleep until the <code>notify()</code> method
in the <b>same</b> object is called.  It will have to be called, obviously, by
another thread, since the thread that called <code>wait()</code> is sleeping.
A typical pattern is that Thread&nbsp;A calls <code>wait()</code> when it
needs a result from Thread&nbsp;B, but that result is not yet available.  When Thread&nbsp;B
has the result ready, it calls <code>notify()</code>, which will wake
Thread&nbsp;A up, if it is waiting, so that it can use the result.  It is not an error to call
<code>notify()</code> when no one is waiting; it just has no effect.  To implement this,
Thread&nbsp;A will execute code similar to the following, where <code>obj</code> is
some object:</p>
   
<pre>if ( resultIsAvailable() == false )
   obj.wait();  // wait for notification that the result is available
useTheResult();</pre>
   
<np>while Thread&nbsp;B does something like:</np>
   
<pre>generateTheResult();
obj.notify();  // send out a notification that the result is available</pre>
   
<p>Now, there is a really nasty race condition in this code.  The two threads
might execute their code in the following order:</p>
   
<pre>1.  Thread A checks resultIsAvailable() and finds that the result is not ready,
        so it decides to execute the obj.wait() statement, but before it does,
2.  Thread B finishes generating the result and calls obj.notify()
3.  Thread A calls obj.wait() to wait for notification that the result is ready.</pre>
   
<np>In Step 3, Thread A is waiting for a notification that will never come,
because <code>notify()</code> has already been called in Step&nbsp;2.  This is a kind of
deadlock that can leave Thread&nbsp;A waiting forever.  Obviously, we need
some kind of synchronization.  The solution is to enclose both Thread&nbsp;A's
code and Thread&nbsp;B's code in <code>synchronized</code> statements, and
it is very natural to synchronize on the same object, <code>obj</code>,
that is used for the calls to <code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code>.
In fact, since synchronization is almost always needed when
<code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code> are used, Java makes
it an absolute requirement.  In Java, a thread can legally call
<code>obj.wait()</code> or <code>obj.notify()</code>
<b>only</b> if that thread holds the synchronization lock
associated with the object <code>obj</code>.  If it does not hold that
lock, then an exception is thrown.  (The exception is of type
<classname>IllegalMonitorStateException</classname>, which does not
require mandatory handling and which is typically not caught.)
One further complication is that the <code>wait()</code> method can throw
an <classname>InterruptedException</classname> and so should be called in
a <code>try</code> statement that handles the exception.</np>
   
<p>To make things more definite, let's consider how we can get a result that 
is computed by one thread to another thread that needs the result.  This
is a simplified producer/consumer problem in which only one item is produced
and consumed.  Assume that there is a shared variable named <code>sharedResult</code> that is
used to transfer the result from the producer to the consumer.  When the
result is ready, the producer sets the variable to a non-null value.
The consumer can check whether the result is ready by testing whether
the value of <code>sharedResult</code> is null.  We will use a variable named
<code>lock</code> for synchronization.  The code for the producer thread
could have the form:</p>
   
<pre>makeResult = generateTheResult();  // Not synchronized!
synchronized(lock) {
   sharedResult = makeResult;
   lock.notify();
}</pre>

<np>while the consumer would execute code such as:</np>
   
<pre>synchronized(lock) {
   while ( sharedResult == null ) {
      try {
         lock.wait();
      }
      catch (InterruptedException e) {
      }
   }
   useResult = sharedResult;
}
useTheResult(useResult);  // Not synchronized!</pre>
   
<p>The calls to <code>generateTheResult()</code> and <code>useTheResult()</code>
are not synchronized, which allows them to run in parallel with other threads that
might also synchronize on <code>lock</code>.  Since <code>sharedResult</code>
is a shared variable, all references to <code>sharedResult</code> should be synchronized,
so the references to <code>sharedResult</code> must be inside the <code>synchronized</code> statements.
The goal is to do as little as possible (but not less) in synchronized code segments.</p>

<p>If you are uncommonly alert, you might notice something funny:  <code>lock.wait()</code>
does not finish until <code>lock.notify()</code> is executed, but since both of these
methods are called in <code>synchronized</code> statements that synchronize on the same
object, shouldn't it be impossible for both methods to be running at the same time?
In fact, <code>lock.wait()</code> is a special case:  When a thread calls
<code>lock.wait()</code>, it gives up the lock that it holds on the synchronization object, <code>lock</code>.
This gives another thread a chance to execute the <code>synchronized(lock)</code> block 
that contains the <code>lock.notify()</code> statement.  After the second thread
exits from this block, the lock is returned to the consumer thread so that it can continue.</p>
   
<p>In the full producer/consumer pattern, multiple results are produced by one or
more producer threads and are consumed by one or more consumer threads.  Instead of
having just one <code>sharedResult</code> object, we keep a list of objects that have
been produced but not yet consumed.  Let's see how this might work in a very
simple class that implements the three operations on a <classname>LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;</classname>
that are used in <code>MultiprocessingDemo3</code>:</p>
 
   
<pre>import java.util.LinkedList;

public class MyLinkedBlockingQueue {
    
    private LinkedList&lt;Runnable&gt; taskList = new LinkedList&lt;Runnable&gt;();
    
    public void clear() {
        synchronized(taskList) {
            taskList.clear();
        }
    }
    
    public void add(Runnable task) {
        synchronized(taskList) {
            taskList.addLast(task);
            taskList.notify();
        }
    }
    
    public Runnable take() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized(taskList) {
            while (taskList.isEmpty())
                taskList.wait();
            return taskList.removeFirst();
        }
    }

}</pre>

<np>An object of this class could be used as a direct replacement for the
<code>taskQueue</code> in <code>MultiprocessingDemo3</code>.</np>

<p>In this class, I have chosen to synchronize on the <code>taskList</code> object,
but any object could be used.  In fact, I could simply use <code>synchronized</code>
methods, which is equivalent to synchronizing on <code>this</code>.  (Note that
you might see a call to <code>wait()</code> or <code>notify()</code> in a
<code>synchronized</code> instance method, with no reference to the object that is being used.
Remember that <code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code> in that context
really mean <code>this.wait()</code> and <code>this.notify()</code>.)</p>

<p>By the way, it is essential that the call to <code>taskList.clear()</code> be
synchronized on the same object, even though it doesn't call <code>wait()</code>
or <code>notify()</code>.  Otherwise, there is a race condition that can
occur: The list might be cleared just after the <code>take()</code> method checks 
that <code>taskList</code> is non-empty and before it removes an item from the
list.  In that case, the list is empty again by the time <code>taskList.removeFirst()</code>
is called, resulting in an error.</p>
   
<break/>

<p>It is possible for several threads to
be waiting for notification.  A call to <code>obj.notify()</code> will wake only one
of the threads that is waiting on <code>obj</code>.  If you want to wake all threads
that are waiting on <code>obj</code>, you can call <code>obj.notifyAll()</code>.
<code>obj.notify()</code> works OK in the above example because only consumer threads
can be blocked.  We only need to wake one consumer thread when a task is added
to the queue because it doesn't matter which consumer gets the task.  But consider
a blocking queue with limited capacity, where producers and consumers can both
block.  When an item is added to the queue, we want to make sure that a consumer
thread is notified, not just another producer. One solution is
to call <code>notifyAll()</code> instead of <code>notify()</code>, 
which will notify all threads including any waiting consumer.</p>

<p>I should also mention a possible confusion about the name of the method <code>obj.notify()</code>.
This method does <b>not</b> notify <code>obj</code> of anything!  It notifies a
thread that has called <code>obj.wait()</code> (if there is such a thread).  Similarly,
in <code>obj.wait()</code>, it's <b>not</b> <code>obj</code> that is waiting for something;
it's the thread that calls the method.</p>

<p>And
a final note on <code>wait</code>:  There is another version of <code>wait()</code>
that takes a number of milliseconds as a parameter.  A thread that calls <code>obj.wait(milliseconds)</code>
will wait only up to the specified number of milliseconds for a notification.  If a notification
doesn't occur during that period, the thread will wake up and continue without the notification.
In practice, this feature is most often used to let a waiting thread wake periodically while it
is waiting in order to perform some periodic task, such as causing a message "Waiting for
computation to finish" to blink.</p>

<break/>
   
<p>Let's look at an example that uses <code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code>
to allow one thread to control another.  The sample program
<sourceref href="TowersOfHanoiGUI.java"/> solves the Towers Of Hanoi
puzzle (<localref href="recursion.1.2"/>), with control buttons that allow the
user to control the execution of the algorithm.  The user can click a "Next Step" 
button to executes just one step in the solution,
which moves a single disk from one pile to another.  Clicking "Run" lets the algorithm 
run automatically on its own; the text on the button changes from "Run" to "Pause", 
and clicking "Pause" stops the automatic
execution. There is also a "Start Over" button that aborts the current solution
and puts the puzzle back into its initial configuration. Here is a picture of
the program in the middle of a solution, including the buttons:</p>

<img src="towers-of-hanoi-gui.png" width="430" height="202" alt="Towers of Hanoi"
      tex="towers-of-hanoi-gui.eps" texscale="0.6"/>

<p>In this program, there are two threads: a thread that runs a recursive algorithm
to solve the puzzle, and the event-handling thread that reacts to user actions.
When the user clicks one of the buttons, a method is called in the event-handling
thread. But it's actually the thread that is running the recursion that has to
respond by, for example, doing one step of the solution or starting over.
The event-handling thread has to send some sort of signal to the solution thread.
This is done by setting the value of a variable that is shared by both threads.
The variable is named <code>status</code>, and its possible values are the
constants <code>GO</code>, <code>PAUSE</code>, <code>STEP</code>, and
<code>RESTART</code>.</p>

<p>When the event-handling thread changes the value 
of this variable, the solution thread should see the new value and respond.
When <code>status</code> equals <code>PAUSE</code>, the solution thread is paused, waiting for
the user to click "Run" or "Next Step".  This is the initial state, when the program
starts.  If the user clicks "Next Step", the event-handling
thread sets the value of <code>status</code> to "STEP"; the solution thread should see the new value and
respond by executing one step of the solution and then resetting <code>status</code>
to <code>PAUSE</code>.  If the user clicks "Run", <code>status</code> is set to
<code>GO</code>, which should cause the solution thread to run automatically.
When the user clicks "Pause" while the solution is running,
<code>status</code> is reset to <code>PAUSE</code>, and the solution thread should return
to its paused state.  If the user clicks "Start Over", the event-handling
thread sets <code>status</code> to <code>RESTART</code>, and the solution thread
should respond by ending the current recursive solution and restoring the puzzle
to its initial state.</p>

<p>The main point for us is that when the solution thread is paused, it is
<i>sleeping</i>.  It won't see a new value for <code>status</code> unless it
wakes up!  To make that possible, the program uses <code>wait()</code> in
the solution thread to put that thread to sleep, and it uses
<code>notify()</code> in the event-handling thread to wake up the
solution thread whenever it changes the value of <code>status</code>.
Here is the <code>actionPerformed()</code> method that responds to
clicks on the buttons.  When the user clicks a button, this method
changes the value of <code>status</code> and calls <code>notify()</code>
to wake up the solution thread:</p>

<pre>synchronized public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
    Object source = evt.getSource();
    if (source == runPauseButton) {  // Toggle between running and paused.
        if (status == GO) {  // Animation is running.  Pause it.
            status = PAUSE;
            nextStepButton.setEnabled(true);  // Enable while paused.
            runPauseButton.setText("Run");
        }
        else {  // Animation is paused.  Start it running.
            status = GO;
            nextStepButton.setEnabled(false);  // Disable while running.
            runPauseButton.setText("Pause");
        }
    }
    else if (source == nextStepButton) {  // Makes animation run one step.
        status = STEP;
    }
    else if (source == startOverButton) { // Restore to initial state.
        status = RESTART;
    }
    notify();  // Wake up the thread so it can see the new status value!
}</pre>

<np>This method is synchronized to allow the call to <code>notify()</code>.
Remember that the <code>notify()</code> method in an object can only 
be called by a thread that holds that object's synchronization lock.
In this case, the synchronization object is <code>this</code>.
Synchronization is also necessary because of race conditions that
arise because the value of <code>status</code> can also be changed
by the solution thread.</np>

<p>The solution thread calls a method named <code>checkStatus()</code>
to check the value of <code>status</code>.  This method calls
<code>wait()</code> if the status is <code>PAUSE</code>, which
puts the solution thread to sleep until the event-handling
thread calls <code>notify()</code>.  Note that if the
status is <code>RESTART</code>, <code>checkStatus()</code> throws
an <classname>IllegalStateException</classname>:</p>

<pre>synchronized private void checkStatus() {
    while (status == PAUSE) {
        try {
            wait();
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e) {
        }
    }
    // At this point, status is RUN, STEP, or RESTART.
    if (status == RESTART)
        throw new IllegalStateException("Restart");
    // At this point, status is RUN or STEP.
}</pre>


<p>The <code>run()</code> method for the solution thread runs in an
infinite loop in which it sets up the initial state of the puzzle
and then calls a <code>solve()</code> method to solve the puzzle.
To implement the wait/notify control strategy,
<code>run()</code> calls <code>checkStatus()</code> before starting
the solution, and <code>solve()</code> calls <code>checkStatus()</code>
after each move.  If <code>checkStatus()</code> throws an
<classname>IllegalStateException</classname>, the call to <code>solve()</code>
is terminated early.  (We used the method of throwing an exception to terminate
a recursive algorithm before, in <localref href="threads.2.2"/>.)
After the <code>solve()</code> method finishes or is terminated by
an exception, the <code>run()</code> method returns to the
beginning of the while loop, where the initial state of the puzzle,
and of the user interface, is restored:
</p>
    
<pre>public void run() {
    while (true) {
        runPauseButton.setText("Run");   // Set user interface to initial state.
        nextStepButton.setEnabled(true);
        startOverButton.setEnabled(false);
        setUpProblem();  // Set up the initial state of the puzzle
        status = PAUSE;  // Initially, the solution thread is paused.
        checkStatus(); // Returns only when user has clicked "Run" or "Next Step"
        startOverButton.setEnabled(true);
        try {
            solve(10,0,1,2);  // Move 10 disks from pile 0 to pile 1.
        }
        catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // Exception was thrown because user clicked "Start Over".
        }            
    }
}</pre>

<p>You can check the full <sourceref href="TowersOfHanoiGUI.java">source code</sourceref>
to see how this all fits into the complete program.  If you want to learn how
to use <code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code> directly, understanding
this example is a good place to start!</p>
