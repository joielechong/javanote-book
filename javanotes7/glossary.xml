<glossary>
<gitem term="abstract class">A class that cannot be used to create objects, and that
exists only for the purpose of creating subclasses.  Abstract classes in Java are
defined using the modifier <code>abstract</code>.</gitem>
<gitem term="abstract data type (ADT)">A data type for which the possible values of the type
and the permissible operations on those values are specified, without specifying how
the values and operations are to be implemented.</gitem>
<gitem term="access specifier">A modifier used on a method definition or variable
specification that determines what classes can use that method or variable.
The access specifiers in Java are <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and
<code>private</code>.  A method or variable that has no access specifier is said
to have "package" visibility.</gitem>
<gitem term="activation record">A data structure that contains all the information 
necessary to implement a subroutine call, including the values of parameters and local
variables of the subroutine and the return address to which the computer will return
when the subroutine ends.  Activation records are stored on a stack, which makes it
possible for several subroutine calls to be active at the same time.  This is particularly
important for recursion, where several calls to the same subroutine can be active
at the same time.</gitem>
<gitem term="actual parameter">A parameter in a subroutine call statement, whose value
will be passed to the subroutine when the call statement is executed.  Actual parameters
are also called "arguments".</gitem>
<gitem term="address">Each location in the computer's memory has an address, which is
a number that identifies that location.  Locations in memory are numbered sequentially.
In modern computers, each byte of memory has its own address.
Addresses are used when information is being stored into or retrieved from memory.</gitem>
<gitem term="algorithm">An unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for performing some task,
which is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of steps.</gitem>
<gitem term="alpha color component">A component of a color that says how transparent or opaque
that color is.  The higher the alpha component, the more opaque the color.</gitem>
<gitem term="API">Application Programming Interface.  A specification of the interface
to a software package or "toolbox."  The API says what classes or subroutines are provided
in the toolbox and how to use them.</gitem>
<gitem term="applet">A type of Java program that is meant to run on a Web page in
a Web browser, as opposed to a stand-alone application.</gitem>
<gitem term="animation">An apparently moving picture created by rapidly showing a sequence of
still images, called frames, one after the other.  In Java, animations are often driven by <classname>Timer</classname>
objects; a new frame of the animation is shown each time the timer fires. </gitem>
<gitem term="antialiasing">Adjusting the color of pixels to reduce the "jagged" effect
that can occur when shapes and text are represented by pixels.  For antialiased drawing,
when the shape covers only part of a pixel, the color of the shape is blended with the
previous color of the pixel.  The degree of blending depends on how much of the pixel
is covered.</gitem>
<gitem term="array">A list of items, sequentially numbered.  Each item in the list can be
identified by its index, that is, its sequence number.  In Java, all the items in 
array must have the same type, called the base type of the array.  An array
is a random access data structure; that is, you can get directly at any item
in the array at any time.</gitem>
<gitem term="array type">A data type whose possible values are arrays.  If <classname>Type</classname>
is the name of a type, then <atype>Type[]</atype> is the array type for arrays that
have base type <classname>Type</classname>.</gitem>

the control of a computer program.  User input events, such as pressing a button on the
mouse, are asynchronous.</gitem>
<gitem term="ASCII">American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
A way of encoding characters using 7 bits for characters.  ASCII code
only supports 128 characters, with no accented letters, non-English alphabets, special symbols,
or ideograms for non-alphabetic languages such as Chinese.  Java uses the much larger and
more complete Unicode code for characters.</gitem>
<gitem term="base case">In a recursive algorithm, a simple case that is handled directly
rather than by applying the algorithm recursively.</gitem>
<gitem term="binary number">A number encoded as a sequence of zeros and ones.  A binary

<gitem term="blocking operation">An operation, such as reading data from a network connection,
is said to "block" if it has to wait for some event to occur.  A thread that performs a blocking
operation can be "blocked" until the required event occurs.  A thread cannot execute any
instructions while it is blocked.  Other threads in the same program, however, can continue
to run.</gitem>
<gitem term="blocking queue">A queue in which the dequeue operation will block if the
queue is empty, until an item is added to the queue.  If the blocking queue has a
limited capacity, the enqueue operation can also block, if the queue is full.</gitem>

the other is a syntax error.</gitem>
<gitem term="class">The basic unit of programming in Java.  A class is a collection 
of static and non-static methods and variables.  Static members of a class are part of
the class itself; non-static, or "instance," members constitute a blueprint for
creating objects, which are then said to "belong" to the class.</gitem>
<gitem term="class variables and class methods">Alternative terms for "static variables" and
"static methods", which are part of the class itself rather than of objects.</gitem>
<gitem term="client/server">A model of network communication in which a "server" waits

The default implementation is used in any class that implements the interface but
does not override the method.  Default methods are marked with the reserved word
<code>default</code>.  Not supported in Java&nbsp;7.</gitem>
<gitem term="default package">The unnamed package.  A class that does not declare itself
to be in a named package is considered to be in the default package.</gitem>
<gitem term="definite assignment">Occurs at a particular point in a program if
it is definitely true that a given variable must have been assigned a value
before that point in the program.  It is only legal to use the value of a local variable if
that variable has "definitely" been assigned a value before it is used.  For this to
be true, the compiler must be able to verify that <b>every</b> path through the program
from the declaration of the variable to its use must pass through a statement that
assigns a value to that variable.</gitem>
<gitem term="deprecated">Considered to be obsolete, but still available for backwards
compatibility.  A deprecated Java class or method is still part of the Java language,
but it is not advisable to use it in new code.  Deprecated items might be removed in
future versions of Java.</gitem>
<gitem term="dialog box">A window that is dependent on another window, called its parent.
Dialog boxes are usually popped up to get information from the user or to display a
message to the user.  Dialog boxes in the Swing API are represented by objects of type
<classname>JDialog</classname>.</gitem>
<gitem term="distributed computing">A kind of parallel processing in which several
computers, connected by a network, work together to solve a problem.</gitem>
<gitem term="dummy parameter">Identifier that is used in a subroutine definition

<gitem term="pixel">A "picture element" on the screen or in an image.  A picture consists of
rows and columns of pixels.  The color of each pixel can be individually set.</gitem>
<gitem term="polymorphism">The fact that the meaning of a call to an instance method
can depend on the actual type of the object that is used to make the call at run time.
That is, if <code>var</code> is a variable of object type, then the method that is called
by a statement such as <code>var.action()</code> depends on the type of the object to which
<code>var</code> refers when the statement is executed at run time, not on the type of
variable <code>var</code>.</gitem>
<gitem term="pointer">A value that represents an address in the computer's memory, and hence
can be thought of as "pointing" to the location that has that address.  A variable in Java can never hold

they are applied, when several operators occur in an expression, in the absence of parentheses.</gitem>
<gitem term="precondition">A condition that must be true at some point in the execution of a program,
in order for the program to proceed correctly from that point.  A precondition of a subroutine
is something that must be true when the subroutine is called, in order for the subroutine to
function properly.  Subroutine preconditions are often restrictions on the values of the actual
parameters that can be passed into the subroutine.</gitem>
<gitem term="priority queue">A data structure representing a collection of items where each item
has a "priority." A priority queue has operations <i>add</i> and <i>remove</i>.  Items

minimal priority.  (Some version of priority queue use maximum instead of minimum priority.)</gitem>
<gitem term="postcondition">A condition that is known to be true at some point in the execution
of a program, as a result of the computation that has come before that point.  A postcondition
of a subroutine is something that must be true after the subroutine finishes its execution.

order in which threads are executed.  A thread with greater priority is executed in preference
to a thread with lower priority.</gitem>
<gitem term="producer/consumer">A classic pattern in parallel programming in which
one or more producers produce items that are consumed by one or more consumers,
and the producers and consumers are meant to run in parallel.  The problem is to get
items safely and efficiently from the producers to the consumers.  In Java, the
producer/consumer pattern is implemented by blocking queues.</gitem>
<gitem term="program">A set of instructions to be carried out by a computer, written
in an appropriate programming language.  Used as a
verb, it means to create such a set of instructions.</gitem>

the opposite end of the list.</gitem>
<gitem term="race condition">A source of possible errors in parallel programming, where
one thread can cause an error in another thread by changing some aspect of the state of 
the program that the second thread is depending on (such as the value of variable).</gitem>
<gitem term="RAM">Random Access Memory.  This term is often used as a synonym for the
main memory of a computer.  Technically, however, it means memory in which all 
locations are equally accessible at any given time.  The term also implies that
data can be written to the memory as well as read from it.</gitem>
<gitem term="recursion">Defining something in terms of itself.  In particular, a
recursive subroutine is one that calls itself, either directly, or indirectly through a
chain of other subroutines.  Recursive algorithms work by reducing a complex problem into
smaller problems which can be solved either directly or by applying the same algorithm "recursively."</gitem>
<gitem term="RGB">A color system in which colors are specified by three numbers (in Java, integers
in the range 0 to 255) giving the red, green, and blue components of the color.</gitem>
<gitem term="reference">Another term for "pointer."</gitem>
<gitem term="return type of a function">The type of value that is returned by that function.</gitem>
<gitem term="reserved word">A sequence of characters that looks like an identifier
but can't be used as an identifier because it has a special meaning in the language.
For example, <code>class</code>, <code>public</code>, and <code>if</code> are reserved
words in Java.</gitem>
<gitem term="resource">An image, sound, text, or other data file that is part of a program.
Resource files for Java programs are stored on the same class path where the compiled class
files for the program are stored.</gitem>
<gitem term="robust program">A program is robust if it is not only correct, but also is
capable of handling errors such as a non-existent file or a failed network connection
in a reasonable way.</gitem>
<gitem term="set">A collection of objects which contains no duplicates.  In Java, sets are
represented by the generic interface <classname>Set&lt;T&gt;</classname></gitem>
<gitem term="scope">The region in a program where the declaration of an identifier is
valid.</gitem>
<gitem term="semantics">Meaning.  The semantics rules of a language determine the
meaning of strings of symbols (such as sentences or statements) in that language.</gitem>
<gitem term="sentinel value">A special value that marks the end of a sequence of data
values, to indicate the end of the data.</gitem>
<gitem term="setter">An instance method in a class that is used to set the value
of some property of that class.  Usually the property is just the value of some
instance variable.  By convention, a setter is named <code>setXyz()</code> where
<code>xyz</code> is the name of the property.</gitem>
<gitem term="signature of a method">The name of the method, the number of formal
parameters in its definition, and the type of each formal parameter.  Method signatures
are the information needed by a compiler to tell which method is being called by
a given subroutine call statement.</gitem>
<gitem term="socket">An abstraction representing one end of a connection between 
two computers on a network.  A socket represents a logical connection between computer
programs, not a physical connection between computers.</gitem>
<gitem term="stack">A data structure consisting of a list of items where items can only be added and removed at
one end of the list, which is known as the "top" of the stack.
Adding an item to a stack is called "pushing," and removing
an item is called "popping."  The term stack also refers to the stack of activation records
that is used to implement subroutine calls.</gitem>
<gitem term="standard input">The standard source from which a program reads input data.  It is 
represented by the object <code>System.in</code>.  Usually, standard input comes from text typed
by the user, but standard input can be "redirected" to read from another source, such as a file,
instead.</gitem>
<gitem term="standard output">The standard destination to which a program writes output text.  It is 
represented by the object <code>System.out</code>.  Usually, standard output is displayed to
the user, but standard output can be "redirected" to write to another destination, such as a file,
instead.  There is also an object <code>System.err</code> that is meant for writing error messages.</gitem>
<gitem term="state machine">A model of computation where an abstract "machine" can be
in any of some finite set of different states.  The behavior of the machine depends on
its state, and the state can change in response to inputs or events.  The basic logical
structure of a GUI program can often be represented as a state machine.</gitem>
<gitem term="step-wise refinement">A technique for developing an algorithm by starting
with a general outline of the procedure, often expressed in pseudocode, and then
gradually filling in the details.</gitem>
<gitem term="stream">An abstraction representing a source of input data or a destination
for output data.  Java has four basic stream classes representing input and output
of character and binary data.  These classes form the foundation for Java's
input/output API.</gitem>
<gitem term="source code">Text written in a high-level programming language, which must
be translated into a machine language such as Java bytecode before it can be executed by
a computer.</gitem>
<gitem term="subclass">A class that extends another class, directly or indirectly, and
therefore inherits its data and behaviors.  The first class is said to be a subclass
of the second.</gitem>
<gitem term="subroutine">A sequence of program instructions that have been grouped together
and given a name.  The name can then be used to "call" the subroutine.  Subroutines are
also called <i>methods</i> in the context of object-oriented programming.</gitem>
<gitem term="subroutine call statement">A statement in a program that calls a subroutine.
When a subroutine call statement is executed, the computer executes the code that is
inside the subroutine.</gitem>
<gitem term="super">A special variable, automatically defined in any instance method,
that refers to the object that contains the method, but considered as belonging to
the superclass of the class in which the method definition occurs.
<code>super</code> gives access to members of the superclass that are hidden by
members of the same name in the subclass.</gitem>
<gitem term="syntax">Grammar.  The syntax rules of a language determine what strings of symbols 
are legal&mdash;that is, grammatical&mdash;in that language.</gitem>
<gitem term="TCP/IP">Protocols that are used for network communication on the Internet.</gitem>
<gitem term="this">A special variable, automatically defined in any instance method,
that refers to the object that contains the method.</gitem>
<gitem term="thread">An abstraction representing a sequence of instructions to be
executed one after the other.  It is possible for a computer to execute several threads
in parallel.</gitem>
<gitem term="thread pool">A collection of "worker threads" that are available to perform tasks.
As tasks become available, they are assigned to threads in the pool.  A thread
pool is often used with a blocking queue that holds the tasks.</gitem>
<gitem term="top-down design">An approach to software design in which you start with the
problems, as a whole, subdivide it into smaller problems, divide those into even smaller
problems, and so on, until you get to problems that can be solved directly.</gitem>
<gitem term="type">Specifies some specific kind of data values.  For example, the type
<ptype>int</ptype> specifies integer data values that can be represented as 32-bit binary numbers.  In Java,
a type can be a primitive type, a class names, or an interface name.  Type names are used to
specify the types of variables, of dummy parameters in subroutines, and of return values of subroutines.</gitem>
<gitem term="type cast">Forces the conversion of a value of one type into another type.
For example, in <code>(int)(6*Math.random())</code>, the <code>(int)</code> is a type-cast
operation that converts the <ptype>double</ptype> value <code>(6*Math.random())</code> into
an integer by discarding the fractional part of the real number.</gitem>
<gitem term="Unicode">A way of encoding characters as binary numbers.  The Unicode character
set includes characters used in many languages, not just English.  Unicode is the character
set that is used internally by Java.</gitem>
<gitem term="URL">Universal Resource Locator; an address for a resource on the Internet, such as a web page.</gitem>
<gitem term="variable">A named memory location (or sequence of locations)
that can be used to store data.  A variable is created in a program, and a name is assigned
to the variable, in a variable declaration
statement.  The name can then be used in that program to refer to the memory
location, or to the data stored in that memory location, depending on context.  
In Java, a variable has a <i>type</i>, which specifies what kind of data it can hold.</gitem>
<gitem term="wrapper class">A class such as <classname>Double</classname> or <classname>Integer</classname>
that makes it possible to "wrap" a primitive type value in an object belonging to the wrapper class.
This allows primitive type values to be used in contexts were objects are required, such as with
the Java Collection Framework.</gitem>
<gitem term="XML">eXtensible Markup Language.  A very common 
and well-supported standard syntax for creating text-based 
data-representation languages.</gitem>
