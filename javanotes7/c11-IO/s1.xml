<p><start><big>W</big>ithout the ability</start> to interact with the rest of
the world, a program would be useless. The interaction of a program with the
rest of the world is referred to as <newword>input/output</newword>
or I/O. Historically, one of the hardest parts of programming language design
has been coming up with good facilities for doing input and output. A computer
can be connected to many different types of input and output devices. If a
programming language had to deal with each type of device as a special case,
the complexity would be overwhelming. One of the major achievements in the
history of programming has been to come up with good abstractions for
representing I/O devices.  In Java, the main I/O abstractions are called 
<newword>streams</newword>.  Other I/O abstractions, such as "files" and "channels"
also exist, but in this section we will look only at streams.  Every stream
represents either a source of input or a destination to which output can be
sent.</p>
   
<subsection id="IO.1.1" title="Character and Byte Streams">

<p>When dealing with input/output, you have to keep in mind that there are two
broad categories of data: machine-formatted data and human-readable text.
Machine-formatted data is represented in binary form, the same way that data is represented
inside the computer, that is, as strings of zeros and ones. Human-readable data
is in the form of characters. When you read a number such as <code>3.141592654</code>, you
are reading a sequence of characters and interpreting them as a number. The
same number would be represented in the computer as a bit-string that you would
find unrecognizable.</p>

<p>To deal with the two broad categories of data representation, Java has two
broad categories of streams: <newword>byte streams</newword> for
machine-formatted data and <newword>character streams</newword> for
human-readable data. There are many predefined classes that represent streams
of each type.</p>

<p>An object that <b>outputs</b> data to a byte stream belongs to one of the
subclasses of the abstract class <classname>OutputStream</classname>. Objects that
<b>read</b> data from a byte stream belong to subclasses of the abstract class
<classname>InputStream</classname>. If you write numbers to an 
<classname>OutputStream</classname>, you
won't be able to read the resulting data yourself. But the data can be read
back into the computer with an <classname>InputStream</classname>. The writing and reading of
the data will be very efficient, since there is no translation involved: the
bits that are used to represent the data inside the computer are simply copied
to and from the streams.</p>

<p>For reading and writing human-readable character data, the main classes are the abstract classes
<classname>Reader</classname> and <classname>Writer</classname>.  All character stream classes are
subclasses of one of these. If a number is to be written to a <classname>Writer</classname>
stream, the computer must translate it into a human-readable sequence of
characters that represents that number. Reading a number from a <classname>Reader</classname>
stream into a numeric variable also involves a translation, from a character
sequence into the appropriate bit string. (Even if the data you are working
with consists of characters in the first place, such as words from a text
editor, there might still be some translation. Characters are stored in the
computer as 16-bit Unicode values. For people who use Western alphabets,
character data is generally stored in files in ASCII code, which uses only 8
bits per character. The <classname>Reader</classname> and <classname>Writer</classname> 
classes take care
of this translation, and can also handle non-western alphabets in countries
that use them.)</p>

<p>Byte streams can be useful for direct machine-to-machine communication,
and they can sometimes be useful for storing data in files, especially when
large amounts of data need to be stored efficiently, such as in large databases.
However, binary data is <i>fragile</i> in the sense that its meaning is not self-evident.
When faced with a long series of zeros and ones, you have to know what information it
is meant to represent and how that information is encoded before you will be able
to interpret it.  Of course, the same is true to some extent for character data,
since characters, like any other kind of data, have to be coded as binary numbers
to be stored or processed by a computer.  But the binary encoding of character data
has been standardized and is well understood, and data expressed in character form
can be made meaningful to human readers.  The current trend seems to be towards
increased use of character data, represented in a way that will make its meaning
as self-evident as possible.  We'll look at one way this is done in <localref href="IO.5"/>.
</p>
   
<p>I should note that the original version of Java did not have character
streams, and that for ASCII-encoded character data, byte streams are largely
interchangeable with character streams. In fact, the standard input and output
streams, <code>System.in</code> and <code>System.out</code>, are byte streams rather
than character streams. However, you should use
<classname>Readers</classname> and <classname>Writers</classname> rather than 
<classname>InputStreams</classname> and
<classname>OutputStreams</classname> when working with character data,
even when working with the standard ASCII character set.
</p>

<p>The standard stream classes discussed in this section are defined in the
package <code>java.io</code>, along with several supporting classes. You must
<code>import</code> the classes from this package if you want to use them in your
program. That means either importing individual classes or
putting the directive "<code>import java.io.*;</code>" at the
beginning of your source file. Streams are necessary for working
with files and for doing communication over a network. They can also be used
for communication between two concurrently running threads, and there are
stream classes for reading and writing data stored in the computer's
memory.</p>

<p>The beauty of the stream abstraction is that it is as easy to write data to
a file or to send data over a network as it is to print information on the
screen.</p>

<break/>

<p>The basic I/O classes <classname>Reader</classname>, <classname>Writer</classname>,
<classname>InputStream</classname>, and <classname>OutputStream</classname> provide 
only very primitive I/O
operations. For example, the <classname>InputStream</classname> class declares an abstract instance
method</p>

<pre>public int read() throws IOException</pre>

<np>for reading one byte of data, as a number in the range 0 to 255, from an input
stream. If the end of the input stream is encountered, the <code>read()</code>
method will return the value -1 instead. If some error occurs during the input
attempt, an exception of type
<classname>IOException</classname> is thrown. Since <classname>IOException</classname> is a
checked exception, this means that you
can't use the <code>read()</code> method except inside a <code>try</code> statement or
in a subroutine that is itself declared with a "<code>throws IOException</code>"
clause. (Checked exceptions and mandatory exception handling were covered in
<localref href="robustness.3.3"/>.)</np>

<p>The <classname>InputStream</classname> class also defines methods for reading multiple
bytes of data in one step into an array of <code>bytes</code>. However,
<classname>InputStream</classname> provides no convenient methods for reading other types of
data, such as <ptype>int</ptype> or <ptype>double</ptype>, from a stream. This is not a
problem because you'll never use an object of type <classname>InputStream</classname> itself.
Instead, you'll use subclasses of <classname>InputStream</classname> that add more convenient
input methods to <classname>InputStream's</classname> rather primitive capabilities.
Similarly, the <classname>OutputStream</classname> class defines a primitive output method
for writing one byte of data to an output stream. The method is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>public void write(int b) throws IOException</code></pre>

<np>The parameter is of type <ptype>int</ptype> rather than <ptype>byte</ptype>, but the 
parameter value is type-cast to type <ptype>byte</ptype> before it is written; this
effectively discards all but the eight low order bits of&nbsp;<code>b</code>.
Again, in practice, you will almost always use higher-level output
operations defined in some subclass of <classname>OutputStream</classname>.</np>

<p>The <classname>Reader</classname> and <classname>Writer</classname> classes 
provide the analogous low-level <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> methods.
As in the byte stream classes,
the parameter of the <code>write(c)</code> method in <classname>Writer</classname>
and the return value of the <code>read()</code> method in <classname>Reader</classname>
are of type <ptype>int</ptype>, but in these character-oriented classes, the I/O operations 
read and write characters rather than bytes.  The return value of <code>read()</code>
is <code>-1</code> if the end of the input stream has been reached.  Otherwise,
the return value must be type-cast to type <ptype>char</ptype> to obtain the
character that was read. In practice, you will ordinarily use higher level
I/O operations provided by sub-classes of
<classname>Reader</classname> and <classname>Writer</classname>, as discussed below.</p>


</subsection>
   
<subsection id="IO.1.2" title="PrintWriter">

<p>One of the neat things about Java's I/O package is that it lets you add
capabilities to a stream by "wrapping" it in another stream object that
provides those capabilities. The wrapper object is also a stream, so you can
read from or write to it&mdash;but you can do so using fancier operations than
those available for basic streams.</p>

<p>For example, <classname>PrintWriter</classname> is a subclass of 
<classname>Writer</classname> that
provides convenient methods for outputting human-readable character
representations of all of Java's basic data types. If you have an object
belonging to the <classname>Writer</classname> class, or any of its subclasses, and you would
like to use <classname>PrintWriter</classname> methods to output data to that
<classname>Writer</classname>, all you have to do is wrap the <classname>Writer</classname> in a
<classname>PrintWriter</classname> object. You do this by constructing a new
<classname>PrintWriter</classname> object, using the <classname>Writer</classname> as input to the
constructor. For example, if <code>charSink</code> is of type <classname>Writer</classname>, then
you could say</p>

<pre>PrintWriter printableCharSink = new PrintWriter(charSink);</pre>

<np>In fact, the parameter to the constructor can also be an <classname>OutputStream</classname>
or a <classname>File</classname>, and the constructor will build a <classname>PrintWriter</classname>
that can write to that output destination.  (Files are covered in the <localref href="IO.2">next&nbsp;section</localref>.)
When you output data to the <classname>PrintWriter</classname> <code>printableCharSink</code>, using
the high-level output methods in <classname>PrintWriter</classname>, that data will go to
exactly the same place as data written directly to <code>charSink</code>. You've
just provided a better interface to the same output destination. For example, this
allows you to use <classname>PrintWriter</classname> methods to send data to a file or over a
network connection.</np>

<p>For the record, if <code>out</code> is a variable of type <classname>PrintWriter</classname>,
then the following methods are defined:</p>
   
<ul>
<li><codedef>out.print(x)</codedef> &mdash; prints the value of <code>x</code>, represented in
the form of a string of characters, to the output stream; <code>x</code> can be an expression
of any type, including both primitive types and object types.  An object is converted to
string form using its <code>toString()</code> method.  A <code>null</code> value is
represented by the string "null".</li>
<li><codedef>out.println()</codedef> &mdash; outputs an end-of-line to the output stream.</li>
<li><codedef>out.println(x)</codedef> &mdash; outputs the value of <code>x</code>, followed
by an end-of-line; this is equivalent to <code>out.print(x)</code> followed by
<code>out.println()</code>.</li>
<li><codedef>out.printf(formatString, x1, x2, ...)</codedef> &mdash; does formatted output
of <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>,&nbsp;<code>...</code> to the output stream.  The
first parameter is a string that specifies the format of the output.  There can
be any number of additional parameters, of any type, but the types of the
parameters must match the formatting directives in the format string. Formatted output
for the standard output stream, <code>System.out</code>, was introduced in 
<localref href="basics.4.1"/>, and <code>out.printf</code> has the same functionality.</li>
<li><codedef>out.flush()</codedef> &mdash; ensures that characters that have been written
with the above methods are actually sent to the output destination.  In some cases,
notably when writing to a file or to the network, it might be necessary to call this
method to force the output to actually appear at the destination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that none of these methods will ever throw an <classname>IOException</classname>.
Instead, the <classname>PrintWriter</classname> class includes the method</p>

<pre>public boolean checkError()</pre>

<np>which will return <code>true</code> if any error has been encountered while writing to
the stream. The <classname>PrintWriter</classname> class 
catches any <classname>IOExceptions</classname>
internally, and sets the value of an internal error flag if one occurs. The
<code>checkError()</code> method can be used to check the error flag. This allows
you to use <classname>PrintWriter</classname> methods without worrying about catching
exceptions. On the other hand, to write a fully robust program, you should call
<code>checkError()</code> to test for possible errors whenever you use a
<classname>PrintWriter</classname>.</np>

</subsection>
   
<subsection id="IO.1.3" title="Data Streams">

<p>When you use a <classname>PrintWriter</classname> to output data to a stream, the
data is converted into the sequence of characters that represents the data in
human-readable form. Suppose you want to output the data in byte-oriented,
machine-formatted form? The <code>java.io</code> package includes a byte-stream
class, <classname>DataOutputStream</classname> that can be used for writing data values to
streams in internal, binary-number format. <classname>DataOutputStream</classname> bears the
same relationship to <classname>OutputStream</classname> that <classname>PrintWriter</classname> bears to
<classname>Writer</classname>. That is, whereas <classname>OutputStream</classname> only has methods for
outputting bytes, <classname>DataOutputStream</classname> has methods 
<code>writeDouble(double&nbsp;x)</code> for outputting values of type 
<ptype>double</ptype>, <code>writeInt(int&nbsp;x)</code>
for outputting values of type <ptype>int</ptype>, and so on. Furthermore, you can
wrap any <classname>OutputStream</classname> in a <classname>DataOutputStream</classname> so that you can
use the higher level output methods on it. For example, if <code>byteSink</code> is
of type <classname>OutputStream</classname>, you could say</p>

<pre>DataOutputStream dataSink = new DataOutputStream(byteSink);</pre>

<np>to wrap <code>byteSink</code> in a <classname>DataOutputStream</classname>.</np>

<p>For input of machine-readable data, such as that created by writing to a
<classname>DataOutputStream</classname>, <code>java.io</code> provides the class
<classname>DataInputStream</classname>. You can wrap any <classname>InputStream</classname> in a
<classname>DataInputStream</classname> object to provide it with the ability to read data of
various types from the byte-stream. The methods in the <classname>DataInputStream</classname>
for reading binary data are called <code>readDouble()</code>, <code>readInt()</code>,
and so on. Data written by a <classname>DataOutputStream</classname> is guaranteed to be in a
format that can be read by a <classname>DataInputStream</classname>. This is true even if the
data stream is created on one type of computer and read on another type of
computer. The cross-platform compatibility of binary data is a major aspect of
Java's platform independence.</p>
   
<p>In some circumstances, you might need to read character data from an
<classname>InputStream</classname> or write character data to an
<classname>OutputStream</classname>.  This is not a problem, since characters,
like all data, are ultimately represented as binary numbers.  However, for character data,
it is convenient to use <classname>Reader</classname> and <classname>Writer</classname>
instead of <classname>InputStream</classname> and <classname>OutputStream</classname>.
To make this possible, you can <b>wrap</b> a byte stream in a character stream.
If <code>byteSource</code> is a variable of type <classname>InputStream</classname>
and <code>byteSink</code> is of type <classname>OutputStream</classname>, then
the statements</p>

<pre>Reader charSource = new InputStreamReader( byteSource );
Writer charSink   = new OutputStreamWriter( byteSink );</pre>
   
<np>create character streams that can be used to read character data from and
write character data to the byte streams.  In particular, the standard input
stream <code>System.in</code>, which is of type <classname>InputStream</classname>
for historical reasons, can be wrapped in a <classname>Reader</classname> to
make it easier to read character data from standard input:</np>
   
<pre>Reader charIn = new InputStreamReader( System.in );</pre>
   
<np>As another application, the input and output streams that are associated with
a network connection are byte streams rather than character streams, but the
byte streams can be wrapped in character streams to make it easy to send
and receive character data over the network.  We will encounter network I/O
in <localref href="IO.4"/>.</np>

<p>There are various ways for characters to be encoded as binary data.
A particular encoding is known as a <newword>charset</newword> or
<newword>character set</newword>.  Charsets have standardized names such as "UTF-16,"
"UTF-8," and "ISO-8859-1."  In UTF-16, characters are encoded as 16-bit UNICODE
values; this is the character set that is used internally by Java.  UTF-8 is
a way of encoding UNICODE characters using 8 bits for common ASCII characters
and longer codes for other characters.  ISO-8859-1, also known as "Latin-1,"
is an 8-bit encoding that includes ASCII characters as well as certain
accented characters that are used in several European languages.
<classname>Readers</classname> and <classname>Writers</classname> use
the default charset for the computer on which they are running,
unless you specify a different one.  This can be done, for
example, in a constructor such as</p>

<pre>Writer charSink = new OutputStreamWriter( byteSink, "ISO-8859-1" );</pre>

<np>Certainly, the existence of a variety of charset encodings has
made text processing more complicated&mdash;unfortunate for us English-speakers
but essential for people who use non-Western character sets.
Ordinarily, you don't have to worry about this, but it's a good idea
to be aware that different charsets exist in case you run into textual data 
encoded in a non-default way.</np>


</subsection>
   
<subsection id="IO.1.4" title="Reading Text">
   

<p>Much I/O is done in the form of human-readable
characters. In view of this, it is surprising that Java does <b>not</b> provide
a standard character input class that can read character data in a manner that
is reasonably symmetrical with the character output capabilities of
<classname>PrintWriter</classname>.  (The <classname>Scanner</classname> class,
introduced briefly in <localref href="basics.4.6"/> and covered
in more detail <localref href="IO.1.5">below</localref>, comes pretty close.)
There is one basic case that is easily
handled by the standard class <classname>BufferedReader</classname>, which
has a method</p>
   
<pre>public String readLine() throws IOException</pre>
   
<np>that reads one line of text from its input source.  If the end of the stream has
been reached, the return value is <code>null</code>.  When a line of text is
read, the end-of-line marker is read from the input stream, but it is not part
of the string that is returned.  Different input streams use different
characters as end-of-line markers, but the <code>readLine</code> method
can deal with all the common cases.  (Traditionally, Unix computers, including Linux
and Mac OS&nbsp;X, use a line feed character, <code>'\n'</code>, to mark an end of line;
classic Macintosh used a carriage return character,&nbsp;<code>'\r'</code>;
and Windows uses the two-character sequence "<code>\r\n</code>".  In general, modern
computers can deal correctly with all of these possibilities.)</np>
   
<p>Line-by-line processing is very common.  Any <classname>Reader</classname>
can be wrapped in a <classname>BufferedReader</classname> to make it easy
to read full lines of text.  If <code>reader</code> is of type <classname>Reader</classname>,
then a <classname>BufferedReader</classname> wrapper can be created for <code>reader</code>
with</p>

<pre>BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader( reader );</pre>
   
<np>This can be combined with the <classname>InputStreamReader</classname> class
that was mentioned above to read lines of text from an <classname>InputStream</classname>.
For example, we can apply this to <code>System.in</code>:</np>
   
<pre>BufferedReader in;  // BufferedReader for reading from standard input.
in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( System.in ) );
try {
   String line = in.readLine();
   while ( line != null ) {  
      processOneLineOfInput( line );
      line = in.readLine();
   }
}
catch (IOException e) {
}</pre>
 
<np>This code segment reads and processes lines from standard input until
an end-of-stream is encountered.  (An end-of-stream is possible
even for interactive input.  For example, on at least some computers, typing a 
<code>Control-D</code> generates an end-of-stream on the standard input stream.)
The <code>try..catch</code> statement is necessary because the <code>readLine</code>
method can throw an exception of type <classname>IOException</classname>, which
requires mandatory exception handling; an alternative to <code>try..catch</code>
would be to declare that the method that contains the code "<code>throws IOException</code>".
Also, remember that <classname>BufferedReader</classname>, <classname>InputStreamReader</classname>,
and <classname>IOException</classname> must be imported from the package
<code>java.io</code>.</np>

<p>Note that the main purpose of <classname>BufferedReader</classname> is not simply to
make it easier to read lines of text.  Some I/O devices work most efficiently if data is
read or written in large chunks, instead of as individual bytes or characters.  A
<classname>BuferedReader</classname> reads a chunk of data, and stores it in internal
memory.  The internal memory is known as a <newword>buffer</newword>.  When you read
from the BufferedReader, it will take data from the buffer if possible, and it will
only go back to its input source for more data when the buffer is emptied. There
is also a <classname>BufferedWriter</classname> class, and there are buffered
stream classes for byte streams as well.</p>
   
<break/>
     
<p>Previously in this book, we have used the non-standard class <classname>TextIO</classname> 
for input both
from users and from files.  The advantage of <classname>TextIO</classname> is that it makes
it fairly easy to read data values of any of the primitive types.  Disadvantages include
the fact that <classname>TextIO</classname> can only read from one input source at a time
and that it does not follow the same pattern as Java's built-in input/output classes.</p>
   
<p>I have written a class named <classname>TextReader</classname> to fix some of these 
disadvantages, while providing input capabilities similar to those of <classname>TextIO</classname>.
Like <classname>TextIO</classname>, <classname>TextReader</classname> is a non-standard
class, so you have to be careful to make it available to any program that uses it.
The source code for the class can be found in the file <sourceref href="TextReader.java"/>.
</p>

<p>Just as for many of Java's stream classes, an object of type 
<classname>TextReader</classname> can be used as a wrapper for an existing input stream,
which becomes the source of the characters that will be read by the <classname>TextReader</classname>.
(Unlike the standard classes, however, a <classname>TextReader</classname> is not
itself a stream and cannot be wrapped inside other stream classes.)  
The constructors</p>

<pre>public TextReader(Reader characterSource)</pre>
<np>and</np>
<pre>public TextReader(InputStream byteSource)</pre>

<np>create objects that can be used to read character data from the given
<classname>Reader</classname> or <classname>InputStream</classname> 
using the convenient input methods of the <classname>TextReader</classname> class.
In <classname>TextIO</classname>, the input methods were static members of the class.
The input methods in the <classname>TextReader</classname> class are instance methods.
The instance methods in a <classname>TextReader</classname> object read from the
data source that was specified in the object's constructor.  This makes it possible
for several <classname>TextReader</classname> objects to exist at the same time, 
reading from different streams;  those objects can then be used to read
data from several files or other input sources at the same time.</np>
   
<p>A <classname>TextReader</classname> object has essentially the same set of
input methods as the <classname>TextIO</classname> class.  One big difference
is how errors are handled.  When a <classname>TextReader</classname> encounters
an error in the input, it throws an exception of type <classname>IOException</classname>.
This follows the standard pattern that is used by Java's standard input streams.
<classname>IOExceptions</classname> require mandatory exception handling, so
<classname>TextReader</classname> methods are generally called inside
<code>try..catch</code> statements.  If an <classname>IOException</classname> is
thrown by the input stream that is wrapped inside a <classname>TextReader</classname>,
that <classname>IOException</classname> is simply passed along.  However,
other types of errors can also occur.  One such possible error is an attempt to read
data from the input stream when there is no more data left in the stream.
A <classname>TextReader</classname> throws an exception of type
<classname>TextReader.EndOfStreamException</classname> when this happens.
The exception class in this case is a nested class in the <classname>TextReader</classname>
class; it is a subclass of <classname>IOException</classname>, so a <code>try..catch</code>
statement that handles <classname>IOExceptions</classname> will also handle
end-of-stream exceptions.  However, having a class to represent
end-of-stream errors makes it possible to detect such errors and provide
special handling for them.  Another type of error occurs when a <classname>TextReader</classname>
tries to read a data value of a certain type, and the next item in the input stream
is not of the correct type.  In this case, the <classname>TextReader</classname>
throws an exception of type <classname>TextReader.BadDataException</classname>,
which is another subclass of <classname>IOException</classname>.</p>
   
<p>For reference, here is a list of some of the more useful instance methods in the
<classname>TextReader</classname> class.  All of these methods can throw
exceptions of type <classname>IOException</classname>:</p>
   
<ul>
<li><codedef>public char peek()</codedef> &mdash; looks ahead at the next
character in the input stream, and returns that character.  The character is
not removed from the stream.  If the next character is an end-of-line,
the return value is&nbsp;'<code>\n</code>'.  It is legal to call this method even
if there is no more data left in the stream; in that case, the return
value is the constant <code>TextReader.EOF</code>.  ("EOF" stands for
"End-Of-File," a term that is more commonly used than "End-Of-Stream", even
 though not all streams are files.)</li>
<li><codedef>public boolean eoln()</codedef> and <codedef>public boolean eof()</codedef> &mdash; 
convenience methods for testing whether the next thing in the file is an
end-of-line or an end-of-file.  Note that these methods do <b>not</b> skip whitespace.
If <code>eof()</code> is false, you know that there is still at least one
character to be read, but there might not be any more <b>non-blank</b> characters
in the stream.</li>
<li><codedef>public void skipBlanks()</codedef> and <codedef>public void skipWhiteSpace()</codedef>
&mdash; skip past whitespace characters in the input stream; <code>skipWhiteSpace()</code>
skips all whitespace characters, including end-of-line while <code>skipBlanks()</code>
only skips spaces and tabs.</li>
<li><codedef>public String getln()</codedef> &mdash; reads characters up to the
next end-of-line (or end-of-stream), and returns those characters in a string.
The end-of-line marker is read but is not part of the returned string.  This will throw
an exception if there are no more characters in the stream.</li>
<li><codedef>public char getAnyChar()</codedef> &mdash; reads and returns the
next character from the stream.  The character can be a whitespace character
such as a blank or end-of-line.  If this method is called after all the characters
in the stream have been read, an exception is thrown.</li>
<li><codedef>public int getInt()</codedef>, <codedef>public double getDouble()</codedef>,
<codedef>public char getChar()</codedef>, etc.  &mdash;  skip any whitespace characters
in the stream, including end-of-lines, then read and return a value of the specified
type.  Extra characters on the line are <b>not</b> discarded and are still available
to be read by subsequent input methods. There is a method for each primitive type.  
An exception occurs if it's not possible to read a data value of the requested type.</li>
<li><codedef>public int getlnInt()</codedef>, <codedef>public double getlnDouble()</codedef>,
<codedef>public char getlnChar()</codedef>, etc.  &mdash;  skip any whitespace characters
in the stream, including end-of-lines, then read a value of the specified
type, which will be the return value of the method.
Any remaining characters on the line are then discarded, including the
end-of-line marker.  There is a method for each primitive type.  An exception occurs if
it's not possible to read a data value of the requested type.</li>
<li><codedef>public void close()</codedef> &mdash; Closes the input stream.  This should be
done when finished reading from the stream.  (<classname>TextReader</classname> implements
the <classname>AutoCloseable</classname> interface and so can be used as a "resource" in

<subsection id="IO.1.5" title="The Scanner Class">
   
<p>Since its introduction, Java has been notable for its lack of built-in support
for basic input, and for its reliance on fairly advanced techniques for the support
that it does offer.  (This is my opinion, at least.)  The <classname>Scanner</classname> 
class was introduced to make it easier to read basic data types from
a character input source.  It does not (again, in my opinion) solve the problem completely,
but it is a big improvement.  (My <classname>TextIO</classname> and <classname>TextReader</classname>
classes are not complete solutions either.)  The <classname>Scanner</classname> class is in the
package <code>java.util</code>.</p>
   
<p>Input routines are defined as instance methods in the <classname>Scanner</classname> class,
so to use the class, you need to create a <classname>Scanner</classname> object.
The constructor specifies the source of the characters that the <classname>Scanner</classname>
will read.  The scanner acts as a wrapper for the input source.
The source can be a <classname>Reader</classname>, an <classname>InputStream</classname>,
a <classname>String</classname>, or a <classname>File</classname>.  (If a <classname>String</classname> 
is used as the input source, the <classname>Scanner</classname> will simply read the characters in the
string from beginning to end, in the same way that it would process the same sequence 
of characters from a stream.  The <classname>File</classname> class will be covered
in the <localref href="IO.2">next section</localref>.)  
For example, you can use a <classname>Scanner</classname> to read from standard input by saying:</p>
   
<pre>Scanner standardInputScanner = new Scanner( System.in );</pre>
   
<np>and if <code>charSource</code> is of type <classname>Reader</classname>, you can create
a <classname>Scanner</classname> for reading from <code>charSource</code> with:</np>
   
<pre>Scanner scanner = new Scanner( charSource );</pre>
   
<p>When processing input, a scanner usually works with
<newword>tokens</newword>.  A token is a meaningful string of characters that
cannot, for the purposes at hand, be further broken down into smaller meaningful
pieces.  A token can, for example, be an individual word or a string of characters
that represents a value of type <ptype>double</ptype>.  In the case of a
scanner, tokens must be separated by "delimiters."
By default, the delimiters are whitespace characters such as spaces, tabs, and end-of-line
markers, but you can change a <classname>Scanner's</classname> delimiters if you need to.
In normal processing, whitespace characters serve simply to separate tokens 
and are discarded by the scanner.  
A scanner has instance methods for reading tokens of various types.  Suppose
that <code>scanner</code> is an object of type <classname>Scanner</classname>.
Then we have:</p>
   
<ul>
<li><codedef>scanner.next()</codedef> &mdash; reads the next token from the input
source and returns it as a <classname>String</classname>.</li>
<li><codedef>scanner.nextInt()</codedef>, <codedef>scanner.nextDouble()</codedef>, and so on &mdash; 
read the next token from the input source and tries to convert it to a value of
type <ptype>int</ptype>, <ptype>double</ptype>, and so on.  There are methods for reading
values of any of the primitive types.
</li>
<li><codedef>scanner.nextLine()</codedef> &mdash; reads an entire line from the input
source, up to the next end-of-line and returns the line as a value of type <classname>String</classname>.
The end-of-line marker is read but is not part of the return value.  Note that this
method is <b>not</b> based on tokens.  An entire line is read and returned, including
any whitespace characters in the line.
</li>
</ul>
   
<np>All of these methods can generate exceptions.  If an attempt is made to read
past the end of input, an exception of type <classname>NoSuchElementException</classname>
is thrown.  Methods such as <code>scanner.getInt()</code> will throw an
exception of type <classname>InputMismatchException</classname> if the next
token in the input does not represent a value of the requested type.  The exceptions
that can be generated do not require mandatory exception handling.</np>
   
<p>The <classname>Scanner</classname> class has very nice look-ahead capabilities.
You can query a scanner to determine whether more tokens are available and whether
the next token is of a given type.  If <code>scanner</code> is of type <classname>Scanner</classname>:</p>
   
<ul>
<li><codedef>scanner.hasNext()</codedef> &mdash; returns a <ptype>boolean</ptype> value
that is true if there is at least one more token in the input source.</li>
<li><codedef>scanner.hasNextInt()</codedef>, <codedef>scanner.hasNextDouble()</codedef>, and so on &mdash; 
returns a <ptype>boolean</ptype> value
that is true if there is at least one more token in the input source and
that token represents a value of the requested type.
</li>
<li><codedef>scanner.hasNextLine()</codedef> &mdash; returns a <ptype>boolean</ptype> value
that is true if there is at least one more line in the input source.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the insistence on defining tokens only in terms of delimiters limits
the usability of scanners to some extent, they are easy to use and are suitable
for many applications.  With so many input classes available&mdash;<classname>BufferedReader</classname>,
<classname>TextReader</classname>, <classname>Scanner</classname>&mdash;you might
have trouble deciding which one to use!  In general, I would recommend using a <classname>Scanner</classname>
unless you have some particular reason for preferring the <classname>TextIO</classname>-style input
routines of <classname>TextReader</classname>.  <classname>BufferedReader</classname> can be
used as a lightweight alternative when all that you want to do is read entire lines of text from
the input source.</p>

<subsection id="IO.1.6" title="Serialized Object I/O">
   
<p>The classes <classname>PrintWriter</classname>, <classname>TextReader</classname>,
<classname>Scanner</classname>,
<classname>DataInputStream</classname>, and <classname>DataOutputStream</classname> 
allow you to easily
input and output all of Java's primitive data types. But what happens when you
want to read and write <b>objects</b>? Traditionally, you would have to come up with
some way of encoding your object as a sequence of data values belonging to the
primitive types, which can then be output as bytes or characters. This is
called <newword>serializing</newword> the object. On input, you have
to read the serialized data and somehow reconstitute a copy of the original
object. For complex objects, this can all be a major chore. However, you can
get Java to do all the work for you by using the classes
<classname>ObjectInputStream</classname> and <classname>ObjectOutputStream</classname>. These are
subclasses of <classname>InputStream</classname> and <classname>OutputStream</classname> that can be used
for writing and reading serialized objects.</p>

<p><classname>ObjectInputStream</classname> and <classname>ObjectOutputStream</classname> are wrapper
classes that can be wrapped around arbitrary <classname>InputStreams</classname> and
<classname>OutputStreams</classname>. This makes it possible to do object input and output on
any byte stream. The methods for object I/O are <code>readObject()</code>, in
<classname>ObjectInputStream</classname>, and <code>writeObject(Object obj)</code>, in
<classname>ObjectOutputStream</classname>. Both of these methods can throw
<classname>IOExceptions</classname>. Note that <code>readObject()</code> returns a value of type
<classname>Object</classname>, which generally has to be type-cast to the actual type of the
object that was read.</p>
   
<p><classname>ObjectOutputStream</classname> also has methods <code>writeInt()</code>,
<code>writeDouble()</code>, and so on, for outputting primitive type values to the stream,
and <classname>ObjectInputStream</classname> has corresponding methods for reading
primitive type values.  These primitive type values can be interspersed with objects
in the data.</p>
   
<p>Object streams are byte streams.  The objects are represented in binary, machine-readable
form.  This is good for efficiency, but it does suffer from the fragility that is often
seen in binary data.  They suffer from the additional problem that the binary format of
Java objects is very specific to Java, so the data in object streams is not easily
available to programs written in other programming languages.
For these reasons, object streams are appropriate mostly for short-term storage of objects 
and for transmitting objects over a network connection from one Java program to another.
For long-term storage and for communication with non-Java programs, other approaches
to object serialization are usually better.  (See <localref href="IO.5"/> for a
character-based approach.)</p>

<p><classname>ObjectInputStream</classname> and <classname>ObjectOutputStream</classname> 
only work with
objects that implement an interface named <classname>Serializable</classname>. Furthermore,
all of the instance variables in the object must be serializable. However,
there is little work involved in making an object serializable, since the
<classname>Serializable</classname> interface does not declare any methods. It exists only as
a marker for the compiler, to tell it that the object is meant to be writable
and readable. You only need to add the words "<code>implements&nbsp;Serializable</code>"
to your class definitions. Many of Java's standard classes are already declared
to be serializable, including all the GUI component classes and many other classes in Swing and in the
AWT. One of the programming examples in <localref href="IO.3"/>
uses object IO.</p>

<p>One warning about using <classname>ObjectOutputStreams</classname>: These streams are optimized to avoid writing
the same object more than once.  When an object is encountered for a second time, only a reference to the first
occurrence is written.  Unfortunately, if the object has been modified in the meantime, the new data will
not be written.  Because of this, <classname>ObjectOutputStreams</classname> are meant mainly for use
with "immutable" objects that can't be changed after they are created.  (<classname>Strings</classname>
are an example of this.)  However, if you do need to write mutable objects to an
<classname>ObjectOutputStream</classname>, and if it is possible that you will write the
same object more than once, you can ensure that the full, correct version of the
object can be written by calling the stream's <code>reset()</code> method before writing the object
to the stream.</p>
